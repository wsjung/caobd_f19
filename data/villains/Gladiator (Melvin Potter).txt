==Fictional character biography==
Melvin Potter was a costume designer who had the deluded belief that he was far better than any superhero. In order to prove his point, he designed a suit of battle armor for himself, complete with deadly wrist blades, and became known as the Gladiator. He battled [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] in his first criminal outing, and then met the [[Masked Marauder (comics)|Masked Marauder]], another enemy of Daredevil's.<ref>''Daredevil'' #18</ref> Gladiator later appeared in Europe, where he fought Daredevil again, and was then invited to join the [[Maggia (comics)|Maggia]].<ref>''Daredevil'' #22-23</ref> He joined [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]]'s [[Emissaries of Evil]] to attack Daredevil again.<ref>''Daredevil Annual'' #1</ref> Later, Gladiator aided [[Madame Masque|Whitney Frost]] in a raid of Stark Enterprises, where he first fought [[Iron Man]].<ref>''Iron Man'' #7-8</ref>

Gladiator later battled Daredevil again.<ref>''Daredevil'' #63</ref> Some time later, he fought Daredevil aboard an airplane in flight.<ref>''Daredevil'' #85</ref> He later allied with the [[Death-Stalker]],<ref>''Daredevil'' #113-114</ref> and later still allied with the [[Abner Jenkins|Beetle]].<ref>''Daredevil'' #140</ref> While under control of the [[Purple Man]], he attacked Daredevil.<ref>''Daredevil'' #154</ref> Gladiator had one last battle against Daredevil before deciding to reform. He began undergoing therapy from Betsy Beatty,<ref>''Daredevil'' #166</ref> whom he later married.

Now reformed, the Gladiator later allied with Daredevil and [[Elektra (comics)|Elektra]] against the [[The Hand (comics)|Hand]].<ref>''Daredevil'' #173-175</ref> Donning his Gladiator costume again, Potter met [[Spider-Man]].<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #77</ref>

Potter was pressured into producing a Daredevil costume for a madman in the employ of the crime lord known as the [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin]], but Murdock comes to tell him to play along.<ref>During the ''[[Daredevil: Born Again|Born Again]]'' storyline, ''Daredevil'' #230-231</ref> Potter later donned his Gladiator costume again to discourage a youth from a life of crime.<ref>''Marvel Comics Presents'' #98</ref>

He was later forced into working for the Kingpin's elderly predecessor [[Alexander Bont]], who claimed that Potter had a four-year-old daughter that he had never met and that she would die if Potter did not help. Gladiator brought Murdock to Bont, who attempted to kill Murdock and assume his old mantle but instead died of a drug-induced heart attack. The Gladiator was defeated by the new [[White Tiger (Angela Del Toro)|White Tiger]], and went back to prison.<ref>''Daredevil'' vol. 2 #67-70</ref>

Gladiator is accused of murdering two fellow inmates and Matt Murdock's law firm is defending him. Murdock's super-senses indicate that he is telling the truth when he claims he is innocent. However, at the end of the issue, taunted by another inmate, Gladiator snaps his handcuffs and brutally assaults the inmate and a corrections officer, only to surrender to another officer and claim once again that he didn't do it. Later, after being broken out of an armored car, Melvin beats a confused Daredevil and moves to the sewers, heading for his Gladiator costume.<ref>''Daredevil'' vol. 2 #95</ref>  Gladiator then goes on a rampage in [[Chinatown]] killing innocent people and then attacking Matt and Milla in a restaurant. After being knocked out, Matt reawakens in a police car to hear a voice that Gladiator will murder his wife. Matt finds the Gladiator and Milla, rescues Milla, and defeats the Gladiator. Melvin realizes what he has done and attempts suicide, but is saved by Daredevil. Potter is taken back to prison, and is heavily sedated after repeatedly banging his head against the wall. It is revealed that [[Mister Fear#Larry Cranston|Mr. Fear]] had secretly administered chemicals to Potter that caused him to go irreversibly insane with rage.<ref>''Daredevil'' vol. 2 #96-99</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Gladiator has no superhuman abilities. However, he is a superb martial arts fighter and is very physically powerful. He wore a thick metal armor with a helmet and metallic gauntlets, and was armed with an arsenal of edged weapons and whirling, jagged circular sawblades made of titanium, one mounted on each gauntlet. Small rotors in the gauntlets cause the blades to rotate at high speeds, and the whirling blades could also be detached to serve as short-range missile weapons.

In civilian life, Potter is an accomplished clothing designer, proficient in drafting, design and sewing.<ref>''Daredevil'' vol. 1 #18</ref>

Matt later visits Melvin at his new garage, but finds that Fisk has anticipated that he would make such a visit, and has had Melvin built a second suit for the purposes of framing him for the ''New York Bulletin'' attack. Matt manages to get Melvin to reveal that Daredevil's impostor is an FBI agent, and the two fight off the SWAT team that raid the warehouse. Matt escapes, while Melvin is arrested for parole violation and assault. Matt later pays Betsy a visit about Melvin being used again, and advises Betsy to leave town so that Fisk can't target her as leverage.<ref>{{cite episode|title=Aftermath|series=Marvel's Daredevil|credits=[[Toa Fraser|Fraser, Toa]] (director); Sarah Streicher (writer)|network=[[Netflix]]|airdate=October 19, 2018|season=3|number=7}} </ref>
