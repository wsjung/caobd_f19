'''Serpent''' ('''Cul Borson''') is a fictional supervillain appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Usually depicted as a foe of [[Odin (Marvel Comics)| Odin]] and [[Thor (Marvel Comics)| Thor]], the Serpent has also come into conflict with the Avengers. He is the brother of Odin, therefore the uncle of Thor, Tyr, Balder, Loki, Laurussa, and [[Angela (comics)| Angela]]. He is known as the Norse '''God of Fear'''.

==Publication history==
Serpent first appeared in ''[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]'' #1 (June 2011), and was created by [[Stuart Immonen]] and [[Matt Fraction]].

==Fictional character biography==
Cul Borson is an enigmatic being who claims that he is the true All-Father of [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]] and not his brother [[Odin (comics)|Odin]]. After being injured upon falling off a peak, Cul crawled into the nearby [[Giants (Marvel Comics)|Giants]] camp and slaughtered them leaving a message stating "Gods do not live in the sky. We live on the Earth. And you do so at our pleasure." Following the death of his father Bor, Cul became the new All-Father and promised to keep his younger brothers Odin, Vili, and Ve as his trusted council. However, Cul did not stick to his word and used his Draumar{{what|date=April 2017}} to spread fear all over the Nine Realms. Cul's brothers worked to stop the beasts that Cul released on Aesheim, but Cul confronted them telling them to go home and allow him to rule. When Odin later confronted Cul, he deemed himself the Serpent as Odin fought him. As Odin was unable to kill Serpent, he sealed him away in an underwater prison and kept his existence a secret.<ref name="Fear Itself #4">{{Cite comic|writer=Fraction, Matt|penciller=Immonen, Stuart|inker=von Grawbadger, Wade|story=Worlds on Fire|title=Fear Itself|volume=1|issue=4|date=September 2011|publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref>

Thousands of years later during the 2011 "[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]" storyline, Serpent was freed from his underwater prison by [[Red Skull]]'s daughter [[Sin (Marvel Comics)|Sin]] who possesses the Hammer of Skadi. Upon emerging as an old man, Serpent prepared Skadi's forces and calls the Hammers of the Worthy which he sends to Earth so that whoever acquires them would help him cause fear and chaos across the globe. This causes some characters on Earth to become his Worthy. [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]] becomes Kuurth: Breaker of Stone, [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] becomes Nul: Breaker of Worlds, [[Attuma]] becomes Nerkodd: Breaker of Oceans, [[Titania (Marvel Comics)|Titania]] becomes Skirn: Breaker of Men, [[Grey Gargoyle]] becomes Mokk: Breaker of Faith, [[Absorbing Man]] becomes Greithoth: Breaker of Wills, and [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] becomes Angrir: Breaker of Souls.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=Fraction, Matt|penciller=Immonen, Stuart|inker=Von Grawbadger, Wade|story=The Serpent|title=Fear Itself|volume=1|issue=1|date=June 2011|publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref> As the Worthy wreaked havoc across the globe, Serpent rejuvenated himself with the collected fears and assumed a younger state in addition to his staff assuming the shape of a hammer. Afterwards, Serpent started forming the Dark Asgard in [[Antarctica]] with a 1,000-eyed creature acting as his [[Heimdall (comics)|Heimdall]]. Upon tracing the Serpent's location, [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] started to head to Dark Asgard as the 1,000-eyed creature alerted Serpent of this. Serpent dispatched his forces to greet Thor after which the Serpent revealed to Thor that a prophecy stated that it was indeed Serpent who Thor slays and dies as a result, not the [[Midgard Serpent (Marvel Comics)|Midgard Serpent]]. Further revealing relation to Odin as his brother and Thor as his nephew, Serpent tried to convince Thor to join him in his cause which Thor promptly refused. This forces Serpent to teleport Thor away to where two of his Worthy (Nul: Breaker of Worlds and Angrir: Breaker of Souls) were waiting to battle the Thunderer.<ref name="Fear Itself #4"/> Serpent later teleported himself to where Skadi was fighting the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. During his battle with the Avengers, Serpent managed to push them back and intercept [[Captain America]]'s shield attack where he managed to break it with his fists. Serpent then raised his hammer and obliterated it in a devastating attack before teleporting away.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=Matt Fraction|penciller=Stuart Immonen|inker=Wade von Grawbadger|story=Brawl|title=Fear Itself|volume=1|issue=5|date=October 2011|publisher=Marvel Comics|page=|panel=}}</ref> In an attempt to destroy Odin and his followers, Serpent and his followers headed to [[Broxton, Oklahoma]] in order to use Heimdall's Observatory to travel to Asgard.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=Matt Fraction|penciller=Stuart Immonen|inker=Wade von Grawbadger|story=Blood-Tied and Doomed|title=Fear Itself|volume=1|issue=6|date=November 2011|publisher=Marvel Comics|page=|panel=}}</ref> After Thor was healed and returned from Asgard, Serpent switched to a giant serpent form and battled his nephew while the Avengers fought the Worthy with the weapons that [[Iron Man]] made in Asgard's workshops. At the end, Thor slew his uncle with Odinsword (revealed to be Ragnarok) and died in the arms of Odin thus fulfilling the prophecy.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=Fraction, Matt|penciller=Immonen, Stuart|inker=Von Grawbadger, Wade|story=Thor's Day|title=Fear Itself|volume=1|issue=7|date=December 2011|publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref> Following Thor's funeral, Odin took Serpent's corpse to Asgard, cast out the other [[Asgardians (Marvel Universe)|Asgardians]], and locked himself alone with the body until the end of time while blaming himself for not preventing Thor's death.{{fact|date=June 2018}}

During the 2014 "[[Original Sin (comics)|Original Sin]]" storyline, Serpent was revived by Odin as he is contacted by [[Loki (comics)|Loki]].<ref>''Original Sin'' #5.4. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Serpent later repented his sins, was pardoned by Odin as a reformed God, and was made Royal [[Inquisitor]] and [[Justice ministry|Minister of Justice]].<ref>''Thor'' Vol. 4 #5. Marvel Comics.</ref> Serpent's first task as the Royal Inquisitor is to retrieve Mjolnir from the [[Jane Foster (comics)|female Thor]]. While using the [[Destroyer (Thor)|Destroyer]] armor, Serpent confronted her as she was about to take action against [[Malekith the Accursed]] and [[Minotaur (comics)|Minotaur]].<ref>''Thor'' Vol. 4 #6. Marvel Comics.</ref> Serpent managed to briefly reclaim Mjolnir until Thor managed to call it back to her. Thor continued her fight against Serpent until she received aid from Thor Odinson, Freyja, and an army of women that Thor Odinson suspected of being the female Thor.<ref>''Thor'' Vol. 4 #7. Marvel Comics.</ref> After a fierce battle, Freyja convinced Odin to call off Serpent's mission by mocking him.<ref>''Thor'' Vol. 4 #8. Marvel Comics.</ref>
