==Fictional character biography==
Frederick Kiber was a scientist who disappeared from public view after announcing his plans to create a means of teleportation. He retreated to a mountain rising from the South Atlantic Ocean, there assisted by a large number of androids. In a terrible accident, the matter transmitter permanently bonded Kiber's body with the molecular structure of his laboratory’s floor. Kiber was transformed into a misshapen semi-humanoid mass of protoplasm bonded to the floor, although he could project images of his former appearance. He gained an overwhelming appetite to consume food, and discovered that he could gain energy by absorbing the consciousnesses and life forces of other human beings, feeling that this would lead him to immortality. He ordered his androids to perfect the matter transmitter, and bring victims for him to absorb.

Kiber had captured the [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]]'s cousin Khanata,{{issue|date=March 2013}} so the Panther came to Kiber's island looking for his cousin. The Panther was captured by the androids and was teleported to Kiber's lair.{{issue|date=March 2013}} Fighting his way free, the Panther discovered where Kiber was fused to the floor. He destroyed all the androids, and taking Khanata’s life energy stored in an energy globe, the Panther left Kiber to perish with no energies to replenish himself.<ref>''Black Panther'' #13</ref>
