Jackson Brice was born in [[Bozeman, Montana]]. Along with [[Fancy Dan]] (Daniel Brito) and [[Ox (comics)|Ox]] (Raymond Bloch), he was a founding member of the [[Enforcers (comics)|Enforcers]].{{Issue|date=January 2011}} He has great proficiency with the [[lasso|lariat]].

Montana, Fancy Dan and Ox make their first appearance under the employ of the [[Big Man (comics)|Big Man]] ([[Frederick Foswell]]).

During their first fight against the web-slinger, Montana's lasso skills initially prove successful but Spider-Man defeats the trio.<ref>{{cite comic| writer = [[Stan Lee]]| artist = [[Steve Ditko]]| colorist = | letterer = | editor = | story = The Enforcers!| title = [[The Amazing Spider-Man]]| volume = 1| issue = 10| date = March 1964| publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]| location = | page = | panel = | id =}}</ref>

Over the next couple of years, Montana and the team would be employed by [[Lightmaster]] in one of his many schemes, again bringing them into conflict with Spider-Man, with similar results.{{Issue|date=May 2011}} They would then lend their services to Tech-Master in his revenge plot against Harry S. Osgood, only to be defeated by [[Dazzler (Marvel Comics)|Dazzler]].{{Issue|date=May 2011}} Montana and the team would also go up against [[She-Hulk]] at one point.{{Issue|date=May 2011}}

Following the 2006 "[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]" storyline, Montana, [[Ox (comics)|Ox]] (Ronald Bloch) and Fancy Dan reunite to work for [[Mister Fear]], which pits them directly against [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]].{{Issue|date=January 2011}} After Mister Fear's arrest, the Enforcers are taken in by the [[Hood (comics)|Hood]]'s organization.{{Issue|date=January 2011}}

Following the events of the 2008 "[[Spider-Man: Brand New Day]]" storyline, the Enforcers are patrons at the [[Bar With No Name]]. They take bets with a person calling himself "The Bookie", over whether Spider-Man will show up to battle "Basher", an unknown villain who claimed to have fought Spider-Man. Spider-Man shows up, but is revealed to be [[Screwball (comics)|Screwball]] in disguise when the real web-head shows up. The Enforcers decide to get revenge on The Bookie, capturing him. The Bookie's father calls Spider-Man for assistance, and he agrees to help. Spider-Man defeats Fancy Dan and Montana.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #562. Marvel Comics.</ref>

In the story arc "Kill To Be You", Montana is the right-hand man of the [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin]] (Wilson Fisk), and shows contempt toward the [[Phil Urich|Hobgoblin]] (Phil Urich). When Spider-Man and the [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]] come to steal back the Reverbium, Montana falls out a window to his death while Hobgoblin saves Kingpin.
