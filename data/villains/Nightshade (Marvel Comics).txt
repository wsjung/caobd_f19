==Fictional character biography==
Tilda Johnson was born into poverty in [[New York City]]. At an early age, she discovered that she had a natural aptitude for science. As a teenager, she used her extensive knowledge to begin a career as a criminal scientist. The [[Yellow Claw (comics)|Yellow Claw]] helped her develop a method for turning normal humans into obedient [[werewolf]]-like creatures, and attempted to transform convicts into a werewolf army, but the pair were defeated by [[Captain America]] and [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]<ref>''Captain America and the Falcon'' #164</ref> She later took control of a S.H.I.E.L.D. facility, and used pheromones to force Captain America to battle the [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]], but was defeated.<ref>''Captain America and the Falcon'' #189-190</ref> She clashes with [[Luke Cage|Power Man]] and [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]] on several occasions.<ref>''Power Man and Iron Fist'' #51-53</ref><ref>''Power Man and Iron Fist'' #110</ref><ref>''Marvel Team-Up Annual'' #3</ref>

Nightshade later appeared as second-in-command of [[Superia]]'s [[Femizons]]. She helps develop a serum to transform men into women which she uses on Captain America and [[Paladin (comics)|Paladin]]. She also helped Superia develop her sterilization bomb.<ref>''Captain America'' #389-391</ref>

She was also involved in a scheme with [[Dredmund Druid]], though as a double agent for Superia. She used a serum to transform Captain America and the ordinary people of Starkesboro, Massachusetts into pseudo-werewolves.<ref>''Captain America'' #403-408</ref>

Nightshade joined [[MODOK]]'s 11, with the main objective of stealing the powerful Hypernova. It has been revealed after her last battle against the [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]], she tried to start her life over without crime.  However, as she was self-taught and had no official degrees, the only medical job she could get was as a receptionist at a hospital. After she pointed out a mistake by one of the doctors, she was fired immediately and contemplated suicide, until MODOK contacted her and hired her for the heist. She had "used up all [her] second chances" and could not afford to turn MODOK down.<ref>''MODOK's 11'' #3</ref> She developed a friendship with her teammates [[Armadillo (comics)|Armadillo]] and [[Puma (comics)|Puma]], and showed this strongly when backing up Puma in saving the [[Living Laser]]'s life (and secretly giving him his Puma powers back through her "werewolf serum"). The three of them were the only villains to remain loyal to MODOK and get their cash (with a bonus); they appear to be sticking together, and she has offered to help Puma with his legal defense.<ref>''MODOK's 11'' #5</ref>

During the ''[[Shadowland (comics)|Shadowland]]'' storyline, Nightshade organized [[Flashmob (comics)|Flashmob]], a group of former Luke Cage enemies, in order to take on the new Power Man, [[Power Man (Victor Alvarez)|Victor Alvarez]]. Although Flashmob was defeated and incarcerated at Ryker's Island, Nightshade's lawyer [[Big Ben Donovan]] mentions that he has plans to have them released from Ryker's Island. Donovan was able to secure the release of some of the members, but others had to remain incarcerated due to the warrants and/or parole violations.<ref>''Shadowland: Power Man'' #2</ref>

During the ''[[Spider-Island]]'' storyline, Nightshade is among the villains that have been infected by the bedbugs that bestowed spider powers on her. She alongside [[Cottonmouth (Cornell Cottonmouth)|Cottonmouth]] and Flashmob ended up fighting [[Heroes for Hire]].<ref>''Spider-Island: Heroes for Hire'' #1</ref>

A reformed Nightshade later allies with the [[Nighthawk (Marvel Comics)#Kyle Richmond (Earth-31916)|Nighthawk]] of Earth-31916, helping him defend Chicago from a group of white nationalists called the True Patriots, and a black supremacist known as "The Revelator".<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = David Walker|penciller = Ramon Villalobos|inker = Ramon Villalobos|colorist = Tamra Bonvillain|letterer = VC's Joe Caramagna|editor = Katie Kubert|title = Nighthawk|volume = 2|issue = #1|date = 25 May 2016|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref> She leaves him shortly afterwards to join [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]] and [[Red Wolf (comics)|Red Wolf]]'s group.<ref>''Occupy Avengers'' #4</ref>

Sometime later, the group stops at Dungston, [[Iowa]] when their van breaks down. Hawkeye calls [[Wheels Wolinski]] to help fix the van until it is revealed that some of the residents are [[Skrulls]], who are being hunted down by mysterious men. While Hawkeye, Red Wolf and Nightshade are fighting, Wolinski discovers that the van has an A.I. system, who convinces him to help in the fight. It is later revealed that the attackers are also Skrulls, led by [[Super-Skrull]]. Wolinski then manages to turn the van into a big robot and defeats Super-Skrull. Hawkeye then negotiates with Nick Fury Jr. to provide protection for the town's residents.<ref>''Occupy Avengers'' #5-7</ref>

During the ''[[Secret Empire (comics)|Secret Empire]]'' storyline, while Hawkeye joins the Underground resistance following [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]]'s takeover in the United States, the rest of the team gather their own resistance army to help the people in rural areas that are being affected by Hydra's cruel treatment. Tilda also reveals that she became the new Nighthawk, after the former was killed by Hydra soldiers. After several successful victories, the resistance heads to a secret base in [[South Dakota]] and prepares for their next attack until Hydra forces raid the base. During the battle, Red Wolf and Tilda have a private conversation, in which both confess their feelings for each other, and they share a kiss. They then head out to help the resistance defeat Hydra.<ref>''Occupy Avengers'' #8-9</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Tilda Johnson is an extraordinary genius, and extensively self-taught in genetics, biochemistry, cybernetics, robotics and physics. She also obtained a doctoral degree from an undisclosed university while in prison.

Nightshade sometimes wears protective battle armor, including silver spikes for protection from attack by werewolves. She has created an array of advanced weaponry, and has built numbers of humanoid robots. She created a chemical serum to transform normal humans into werewolves under her control and has used concentrated pheromones to control men through her allure.

Nightshade apparently secretes chemical pheromones from her body that affect the will of certain animals, including werewolves, making them obedient to her commands.

A product of Mariah's constant rapes by her great-uncle "Pistol Pete" Stokes, Mariah gave birth to Tilda after her grandmother "Mama" Mabel Stokes would not allow her to have an abortion. For all of her childhood and early adult life, Tilda believed her father was Mariah's late husband Dr. Jackson Dillard, and she was raised by Mariah's cousins, the Johnsons (explaining her different surname). The circumstances of Tilda's conception led Mariah having a strained relationship with her over the years. Of the other Stokes family members, Tilda was closest with [[Cottonmouth (Cornell Stokes)|Cottonmouth]].<ref name="ForPetesSake" /> At the start of season two, Tilda works as a holistic doctor. Mariah, at the suggestion of her publicist, tries to reconnect with Tilda and an effort to use her for publicity, to which she begrudgingly agrees to. Tilda does not call herself "Nightshade", with the name being alluded to instead as an herb that is the key ingredient in the recipe that gives Bushmaster his healing powers.<ref>{{cite episode|title=Straighten It Out|series=Marvel's Luke Cage|credits=Green, Steph (director); Akela Cooper (writer)|network=[[Netflix]]|airdate=June 22, 2018|season=2|number=2}}</ref> Initially forced by one of Bushmaster's minions to help save him, she begins giving him more of it and covers for him once detective [[Misty Knight]] and the police begin looking for him. While under police protection following an attack by Bushmaster, Mariah later tells Tilda the truth about her father, her crimes, and killing Cottonmouth.<ref name="ForPetesSake">{{cite episode|title=For Pete's Sake|series=Marvel's Luke Cage|credits=Johnson, Clark (director); Matt Owens & Ian Stokes (writer)|network=[[Netflix]]|airdate=June 22, 2018|season=2|number=9}}</ref> Tilda's disgust with Mariah reaches its boiling point when she massacres a restaurant of innocent people in an effort to lure Bushmaster out of hiding.<ref>{{cite episode|title=The Main Ingredient|series=Marvel's Luke Cage|credits=Goddard, Andy (director); Akela Cooper (writer)|network=[[Netflix]]|airdate=June 22, 2018|season=2|number=10}}</ref> This leads to Tilda disowning Mariah and eventually, fatally poisoning her in jail. After she kills Mariah, Tilda assumes everything in her mother's will would be left to her, but Mariah leaves Harlem's Paradise to Luke, and only leaving Cottonmouth's keyboard to Tilda. This amplifies the intensity and contentious relationship between her and Luke. In the last episode of season 2, she is seen donning the character's signature afro puffs from the comic books, while entering a post-Stokes/Dillard Harlem's Paradise with Luke in the office that Cornell and Mariah once ran their syndicate from.<ref>{{cite episode|title=They Reminisce Over You|series=Marvel's Luke Cage|credits=Lopez, Alex Garcia (director); Cheo Hodari Coker (writer)|network=[[Netflix]]|airdate=June 22, 2018|season=2|number=13}}</ref>
