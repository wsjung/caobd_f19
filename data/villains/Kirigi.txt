==Fictional character biography==
While it is known that the ninjas of ancient [[Japan]] feared Kirigi, little else is known of his history.

Kirigi is an opponent of both [[Chaste (Marvel Comics)|The Chaste]], a group commanded by [[Stick (comics)|Stick]], and two of Stick's former pupils, [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] and [[Elektra (comics)|Elektra Natchios]]. This hatred eventually prompts the Hand to resurrect him in order to destroy Elektra. This plot eventually reaches its climax as Elektra, walking into a trap laid by the Hand, attempts to kill the Hand's Jonin (ninja master) with the assistance of Daredevil. Instead of meeting the Jonin, she meets Kirigi. In response, she stabs him with two sai; however, he merely pulls them out effortlessly. He then dupes her into going for her sai, only to choke her with his rope knife. However, she manages to impale him with her blade, forcing him to break off the fight. A day later, however, he returns to attack Elektra again after recovering from his wounds using meditation and mystic ointments. Once again, a fierce battle ensues. Elektra flees into a semi-rig and smashes into him at a high speed. She then leaps out of the semi-rig before it explodes. In spite of this, Kirigi merely stands back up, though his skin is still engulfed in flames. Finally, Elektra simply decapitates him as he tries to regain his bearings, saying: "God or demon, Kirigi had a neck and that was human enough."<ref>''Daredevil'' Vol1 #175-176 (October November 1981)</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theothermurdockpapers.com/2010/03/the-hand-the-life-and-first-death-of-kirigi/|date=14 March 2010|work=The Other Murdock Papers|accessdate=22 November 2011|title=The Hand â€“ The life and (first) death of Kirigi}}</ref>

Several Hand ninjas soon clash with the Chaste and Daredevil and sacrifice their lives in order to resurrect Kirigi once again, to aid them in their battle against the Chaste and Daredevil. At the moment, Daredevil has temporarily lost control of his enhanced senses and is in an isolation tank with Stick, who is trying to help him regain control of them. The newly revived Kirigi attempts to ambush Stick, but he is no match for the Chaste warriors, who collectively are able to defeat him. Stick then orders Kirigi's body destroyed to prevent him from being resurrected once again.<ref>''Daredevil'' Vol1 #187-188 (October November 1982)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Kirigi has a seemingly superhuman resistance to pain and injury. He is capable of lifting at least 1,000 pounds. Both a weapons master and an accomplished martial artist, his various areas of expertise include the use of the Katana, Shuriken, Kyoketsu Shogi (rope knife), and sai. In addition, the use of a form of meditation allows him to recover from otherwise-mortal wounds. As a result, he is virtually impervious to all but devastating wounds.
