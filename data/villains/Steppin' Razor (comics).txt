Carlyle reveals that he has hired four men from Blade's past to kidnap him in an effort to bring peace between Blade and the vampire houses. At this point Steppin' Razor and the other Bad Bloods reveal themselves as the kidnappers and kill Carlyle.  Having him at his mercy, Steppin' Razor orders the torture of Blade. He reveals his plan to turn Blade over to the House of Cththon in exchange for membership in that house. This plan fails when a friend of Blade's finds and frees him. Blade then kills all of the Bad Bloods except Steppin' Razor who escapes.<ref>{{cite episode|title=Bloodlines|series=Blade: The Series|credits=Alcala, Felix Enriquez (director); Geoff Johns (writer)|network=[[Paramount Network|Spike]]|airdate=July 19, 2006|season=1|number=5}}</ref>

Days later Steppin' Razor hunts down and kills a police officer name Flannigan and then nearly kills a nurse name Viola. Flashbacks reveal both people helped care for Blade when he was a boy. Steppin' Razor's next target is the man who raised Blade as a child, the man Blade identifies as his father.

The resulting fight ends when Blade's father runs Blade's sword through Steppin' Razor, reducing him to ash.<ref>{{cite episode|title=Sacrifice|series=Blade: The Series|credits=Straiton, David (director); Chris Ruppenthal (writer)|network=[[Paramount Network|Spike]]|airdate=August 9, 2006|season=1|number=8}}</ref>
