==Fictional character biography==
Jennifer Stavros was born in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]]. As a teenager, Jennifer was recruited into the [[Hellions (Marvel Comics)|Hellions]] and enrolled at [[Emma Frost|Emma's Frost's]] Massachusetts Academy where she was covertly trained in combat as one of the Hellions, the teenage enforcement squad of the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|HellFire Club]]. One of the team's first missions was to confront the [[New Mutants]], who were attacking [[Massachusetts Academy (comics)|the Massachusetts Academy]] in an attempt to retrieve their kidnapped schoolmate, X-man [[Kitty Pryde]]. The Hellions met with mixed success against the New Mutants in their first conflict. Roulette was able to neutralize New Mutants [[Sunspot (comics)|Sunspot]] and [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Wolfsbane]] in this initial meeting by making Sunspot's back muscles go into spasm and a bookshelf to crash on to Wolfsbane.<ref>''New Mutants, volume 1'' #16-17 (June, July 1984)</ref>

Roulette begins a guarded flirtation with one of her teammates, [[Empath (comics)|Empath]], with whom she shares an enthusiasm for making others suffer.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #193 (May 1985)</ref>  As such, both she and Empath, along with [[Firestar (Marvel Comics)|Firestar]], a recent addition to the Massachusetts Academy, follow their teammate [[Warpath (comics)|James Proudstar]] (using his then codename Thunderbird) as he confronts the [[X-Men]] over this brother [[Thunderbird (comics)|John]]'s death. During this conflict, Roulette is able to use her probability altering powers to cause the X-Men's cloaking mechanisms to malfunction, and also to generate an electrical feedback loop in the Blackbird's portable [[Cerebro]] unit.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #193 (May, 1985)</ref>

At a party thrown by the Hellfire Club, Roulette turned her charms on New Mutant [[Cypher (comics)|Cypher]]. She surreptitiously used her luck altering powers to cause Cypher to win several hands of poker. However, after getting drunk, Cypher hits her in a paranoid fit.<ref>''New Mutants'' #53</ref>

Roulette is present when the New Mutants briefly join the Massachusetts Academy following the events of [[Secret Wars II|Secrets Wars]].<ref>''New Mutants'', volume 1 #39 (May 1986)</ref> She is likewise present when the Hellions confront the New Mutants as both teams attempt to capture a runaway mutate creature known as [[Bird-Brain (Marvel Comics)|Bird-Brain]]. During this mission, she is able to use her good luck discs to save herself and teammate [[Catseye (comics)|Catseye]] from a high altitude fall, causing their landings to occur on a cushioned canopy<ref>''New Mutants'', volume 1 #56 (October 1987)</ref>

Roulette was part of the force of Hellions that attacked the [[New Warriors]] over the fate of Firestar, a former member. At first, her powers were deflected back on her teammates but when the battles degenerated to one on one, she easily took down [[Robbie Baldwin|Speedball]]. Eventually the Hellions left, having lost due to the competition deal between the White Queen and Tai, the unofficial force behind the Warriors.<ref>''New Warriors'' #9-10 (March–April 1991)</ref>

Soon after, at another Hell Fire Club engagement (attended by both the Hellions and the [[X-Men]] Gold Team) Roulette, along with most of her teammates is killed, either by Sentinels or by [[Trevor Fitzroy]] in order to fuel his [[time travel]]ing [[Teleportation| teleportation portals]].<ref>off-panel in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #282 (1991)</ref>

===Necrosha===
Roulette appears in the [[Necrosha]] event in ''New Mutants'' (vol. 3), along with the other deceased Hellions, having been resurrected by [[Selene (comics)|Selene]]'s magic and the [[transmode virus]].<ref>''New Mutants'' volume 3 #7-8 (2010)</ref> She again appears infected with the transmode virus in the "Fight the Future" arc of ''New Mutants'' (vol. 3).<ref>''New Mutants'' volume 3 #48-49 (2012)</ref> Her interest in Cypher was apparently more than just indulgence of her love of mischief; during the Necrosha storyline, when Roulette - resurrected by Selene - is temporarily possessed by Karma, interrupting Selene's psychic control, she reflects over Cypher's prone form that she used to 'think (she) loved' him.{{issue|date=September 2015}}

==Powers and abilities==
Roulette has the mutant power to alter [[probability]]. She can generate discs of psychic energy that alter the laws of chance, resulting in either good or bad luck for their targets. Her black energy discs create "bad luck" while her red energy discs create "good luck."
