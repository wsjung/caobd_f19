'''Tombstone''' ('''Lonnie Thompson Lincoln''') is a fictional [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. A hulking [[albino]] man with filed teeth, Tombstone is a notorious crime boss in [[New York City]]. He is primarily an enemy of [[Spider-Man]] and [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]], and the father of [[Janice Lincoln]]. 

The character has appeared in various media including two animated series (''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]'' and ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)|The Spectacular Spider-Man]]''), and the animated film ''[[Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse]]''.

==Publication history==
[[File:Tombstone comic.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Tombstone on the cover of ''[[Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' #139.<br>Art by [[Sal Buscema]].]]
The character was created by [[Gerry Conway]] and [[Alex Saviuk]] and first appeared in ''[[Web of Spider-Man]]'' #36 (March 1988). The character was immediately established to have a history with longtime Spider-Man [[supporting character]] [[Robbie Robertson (comics)|Joseph "Robbie" Robertson]], and was brought on as a regular in ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'', which was then being written by Conway. Conway explained why he created Tombstone: "My general motivation was a need to work with the characters who weren't central to ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' title, since that was the main book. That meant I needed to focus my attention not on [[Aunt May]] or [[Mary Jane Watson|Mary Jane]], or even [[J. Jonah Jameson]], but on second- or even third-tier supporting characters. Joe Robertson was one of those. The second motive had to do with my desire to bring back the ruthless gangster [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]] had been, but not Hammerhead himself. It just came to me as a character type. One thing led to another, and as his backstory expanded, readers responded well to it."<ref>{{cite journal|last= Williams|first= Scott E.|date= October 2010|title= Gerry Conway: Everything but the Gwen Stacy Sink|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= 44| page= 17|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
Born as Lonnie Thompson Lincoln in [[Harlem]], in [[New York City]], he started out as troubled youth who was bullied by his peers because he was Harlem's only [[African American]] [[albino]]. Taller and stronger than the other children, he became a school bully, extorting [[protection money]] from his classmates. The school newspaper, edited by [[Robbie Robertson (comics)|Joseph "Robbie" Robertson]], was going to run a story on Lonnie's activities, but pulled it when Lonnie used scare tactics to intimidate Robertson. Lonnie allowed his personal demons to direct the course of his life and he turned to a life of serious crime.{{issue|date=December 2017}} As a [[hitman]] and enforcer, he used his albinism to his advantage. He filed his teeth and nails to points, giving him the appearance of a [[vampire]]. This frequently caught his opponents off-guard, making it easier to kill them. He also lifted weights and engaged in many street fights to hone his fighting skills. As an adult, he stood over six feet, seven inches tall.{{issue|date=December 2017}} One night, Robertson, now working for a local paper, went to meet a source only to see the source being killed by Lincoln. He threatened to kill Robertson if the story was brought out. Robertson kept the secret for over twenty years whilst Lincoln became a powerful mob enforcer, killing many others.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #137</ref>

Now known as "Tombstone" on the street, he returned to New York City as the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]]'s hitman.<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' #36</ref> Tombstone threw the [[Jason Macendale|Hobgoblin]] out of the [[Arranger (comics)|Arranger]]'s window.<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' #38</ref> Tombstone captured a mutant known as the [[Persuader (Marvel Comics)|Persuader]] for the Arranger.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #138</ref> Lonnie returned to Robertson's neighborhood. Eventually Robertson went to the police which resulted in Tombstone's incarceration, but not before Tombstone confronted and seriously injured Robertson, nearly permanently damaging Robertson's spine.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #139</ref> Tombstone then encountered [[Spider-Man]] in Atlanta, Georgia; Tombstone was defeated and sent to the Philadelphia State Penitentiary.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #142</ref>

Robertson was also incarcerated for suppression of evidence. On learning this, Tombstone obtained a transfer to Lewsiburg State Penitentiary where Robertson was incarcerated. In prison, Tombstone killed Robertson's befriended bodyguard Bruiser. Tombstone eventually broke out of prison but was confronted by [[Spider-Man]]; he eluded capture after a harrowing battle in which he nearly beat Spider-Man to death before Robertson stopped him. Tombstone and Robertson were knocked into the Susquehana River.  Tombstone brought a badly-injured Robertson to an Amish family so that Robertson could recover enough to give him a decent fight. When Tombstone finally made his move to kill Robertson in retaliation for turning on him during the fight with Spider-Man, Robertson stabbed Tombstone with a pitchfork and then escaped. Tombstone joined a criminal organization, headed by [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]] and the [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]], and then saved Robertson from Hobgoblin so that he could kill Robertson himself.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #150, 153, 155, 157, 161</ref> Robertson was then given a full pardon for helping recapture Tombstone.{{Issue|date=May 2009}}

Tombstone eventually gained a [[superhuman]] physical constitution. Tombstone encountered Robertson at the Osborn Chemical Plant. Robertson shot Tombstone and trapped him in an airtight test chamber which contained an experimental gas. The gas was absorbed into Tombstone's bloodstream and had a mutagenic effect on his body, enhancing his strength and heightening his other physical abilities. Tombstone then called off his vendetta against Robertson in gratitude.<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' #66-68</ref> Tombstone was later defeated by [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] and the [[Punisher]] while competing against the [[Taskmaster (comics)|Taskmaster]] in a real game of [[Assassin (game)|Assassin]] sponsored by the [[The Hand (comics)|Hand]].<ref>''Daredevil'' #292-293</ref>

Tombstone was hired by the [[Norman Osborn|Green Goblin]] to be part of the Spider-Man killing group, the [[Sinister Twelve]], but was defeated.<ref>''Marvel Knights Spider-Man'' #10-11</ref>

Tombstone was hired by [[Lily Lucca]] to pretend he kidnapped Lily and to fight Daredevil, but Tombstone was beaten by Daredevil.<ref>''Daredevil'' vol. 2 #90-91</ref>

Tombstone joined the [[Hood (comics)|Hood]]'s army of criminals.<ref>''Punisher (2009)'' #4</ref> He later returned to pester [[Deadpool]] in the miniseries: ''Deadpool - Suicide Kings''.{{issue|date=December 2017}}

Tombstone was with the Hood when he presents the [[Mac Gargan|Scorpion]]'s costume to whichever low-level crook impresses him until the party is crashed by the [[Scorpion (Carmilla Black)|Scorpion]] stealing the costume.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #626</ref>

During the "Origin of the Species" storyline, [[Doctor Octopus]] invites Tombstone to join a supervillain team in exchange for some items. Both Dr. Octopus and [[Shocker (comics)|Shocker]] attack [[Menace (Marvel Comics)|Menace]]'s infant in a restaurant until Spider-Man interferes.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #642</ref> Later, Tombstone confronts [[Carlie Cooper]].<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #643</ref> However, the police arrive and Tombstone escapes, but later doubles back to follow Cooper after discovering that Cooper knows who Menace really is.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #644</ref> He corners Cooper, [[Mary Jane Watson]] and Menace, but Menace manages to knock him out by activating the Goblin glider and sending it crashing into him.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #645</ref> The police soon arrive and take Tombstone away.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #646</ref>

It is later revealed that Tombstone is the father of the new Beetle ([[Janice Lincoln]]).<ref>''Superior Foes of Spider-Man'' #6-7</ref>

Tombstone has a battle with Spider-Man.<ref>''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #204-206</ref> During a police shootout Tombstone critically injured a friend of cop Yuri Watanabe, the fourth [[Wraith (Marvel Comics)|Wraith]]. Tombstone was set free by the judge, as Tombstone saved his wife from cancer.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #16.1</ref> However [[Mister Negative]] supplied Watanabe with evidence of Tombstone having a hold on the judge, putting them both in prison.  {{issue|date=July 2016}} The judge was killed by a prisoner who worked for Tombstone. {{issue|date=July 2016}} When [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]], an Inner Demon disguised as the [[Crime Master]], and the [[Enforcers (comics)|Enforcers]] attempted a jail break the Inner Demon shot Tombstone in the chest.{{issue|date=July 2016}}

Tombstone is later approached by [[Mr. Fish]] who warns him about Black Cat's gang targeting him and his criminal empire in the upcoming gang war in Harlem.<ref>''Power Man and Iron Fist'' Vol. 3 #10</ref> Tombstone and Mr. Fish are later visited by [[Alex Wilder]] who talks about his father Geoffrey Wilder's [[Pride (comics)|family business]] as the two of them knew him back when he was still alive. He also tells Tombstone and Mr. Fish that he is starting a new incarnation of the Pride which he will start in Harlem. Afterwards, Alex Wilder beats up Tombstone and uses a magic spell to send Mr. Fish to Hell.<ref>''Power Man and Iron Fist'' Vol. 3 #11</ref> After recovering from the attack, Tombstone rescues Mr. Fish from Hell with the help of [[Black Talon (comics)|Black Talon]].<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = David F.

==Powers and abilities==
{{unsourced section|date=December 2017}}
Originally, Lonnie Lincoln had no superhuman powers, but has gained them through artificial means as a result of a mutagenic reaction to an experimental preservative gas absorbed into his bloodstream. He possesses physical strength that has been increased beyond his original limits to superhuman levels. Tombstone's body is highly resistant to physical injury and is capable of withstanding extreme temperatures, great impact forces, high caliber bullets and toxic gases without sustaining injury. His reflexes, speed, and stamina are likewise heightened beyond a range attainable for normal human beings.

Aside from these advantages, he is an excellent hand-to-hand combatant with years of street fighting experience and, even before gaining powers, was easily capable of killing someone with his bare hands. He now combines his street-fighting skills with his superhuman strength to create a unique fighting style. He is also highly proficient with conventional firearms and well connected in the underworld of organized crime.

As an albino, Tombstone is sensitive to sunlight due to a natural deficiency of [[melanin]]. He is usually depicted as only being capable of speaking in whispers. However, after the exposure to gas at OsCorp, he has been depicted speaking in tones approaching normal vocal tones.

Tombstone has filed all his teeth into razor-sharp points.

He met Spider-Girl and did battle with her, but when he saw another Spider-Girl saving people from a burning building on TV Tombstone grew furious and rapidly finished her off. {{Issue|date=July 2009}}

When Tombstone met the Blue Spider-Girl, he revealed to her that he killed the other Spider-Girl, which caused her to attack him in rage. Tombstone was surprised that she has symbiote powers and was defeated. At first thinking he will be on the streets again soon since he believes heroes cannot kill, the Blue Spider-Girl suffocates and kills him. {{Issue|date=July 2009}}
