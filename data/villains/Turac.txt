Turac was a Turkish warlord in the 15th century, and an enemy of [[Dracula (Marvel Comics)|Dracula]] while he was still a mortal.  In 1459, while leading a Turkish army to conquer Transylvania, he found Dracula, who had been wounded in battle.  Turac took Dracula to a gypsy woman named [[Lianda]] to be healed.  Lianda was actually a [[Vampire (Marvel Comics)|vampire]] and turned Dracula into a vampire as well.  Dracula awoke to find himself Turac's prisoner, unaware of the transformation he had gone through.  Turac had raped Dracula's wife Maria, who died while trying to flee Turac.  Furious upon seeing Turac, Dracula broke free of his chains and slew Turac, who became a vampire like himself.{{issue|date=December 2011}}
