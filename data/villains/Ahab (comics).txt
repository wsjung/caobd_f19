==Publication history==
{{expand section|date=December 2017}}
Based upon [[Herman Melville]]'s [[Captain Ahab (Moby-Dick)|Captain Ahab]],{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} but also named after [[Stan Lee]]'s childhood friend Rory Campbell from Portland, Oregon,{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} Ahab is a [[cyborg]]. Ahab's first appearance was a [[cameo appearance|cameo]] in ''[[Fantastic Four (comic book)|Fantastic Four Annual]]'' #23, as part of the "[[Days of Future Present]]" storyline.

==Fictional character biography==
In his future timeline, Ahab was the master of the [[Hounds (comics)|Hounds]], [[mind control]]led [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutants]] who hunted down other mutants for Ahab and his masters, the [[Sentinels (comics)|Sentinels]]. One of the Hounds, [[Rachel Summers]], escaped from him and eventually [[time travel]]led to the present. Ahab followed her to the past and was defeated by the [[X-Men]], [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]], the [[New Mutants]] and the [[Fantastic Four]] during the "[[Days of Future Present]]" [[fictional crossover|crossover]].<ref>Fantastic Four Annual #23, X-Factor Annual #5, New Mutants Annual #6, Uncanny X-Men Annual #14</ref>

Later issues of ''[[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]]'' revealed that scientist Rory Campbell was the man who would become Ahab in the future.<ref>''Excalibur'' Vol 1 #75</ref> Campbell learned of this in the present and tried to prevent this fate, but as time passed he lost half of one leg to a security device designed to respond to violent action, after exposure to the pheromones of the Acolyte Spoor, and traded all his knowledge on the Legacy Virus to Sebastian Shaw, in exchange for a cybernetic leg. He was also apparently chosen to joined the [[Four Horsemen of Apocalypse (comics)|Four Horsemen]] of the immortal supervillain [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]], where he was altered and now resembling Ahab, he took up the position of "Famine" within that group and aided in the capture of several of [[Apocalypse (comics)#The Twelve|The Twelve]],<ref>''X-Men'' (2nd series) #96</ref> before being sent into an alternate dimension by [[Mikhail Rasputin]].<ref>''X-Men'' (2nd series) #97</ref>

He was transported to the not too distant future, where he captured and killed [[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]] (who is immortal).{{issue|date=October 2014}} He worked beside an armored figure, with light coming from his left eye. Due to time travel, it is not known at what point in Ahab's life this was.<ref>''Cable'' #71</ref>

Ahab joined the Red Skull as one of his [[S-Men]] to fulfill his role during World War Hate.<ref>''Uncanny Avengers'' #23</ref>

During the ''[[AXIS (comics)|AXIS]]'' storyline, Ahab was present when Magneto killed the S-Men.<ref>''Uncanny Avengers'' #25</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Ahab can generate powerful energy harpoons that are formed from, and attached to, his own life force. Anyone who attempts to grab a harpoon gets burned. Each harpoon is keyed to its target's genetic structure, and cannot be moved or deflected by energy; it only stops when it strikes its target, or a close blood relative thereof. A hit from one of these harpoons can kill or seriously injure the target. A person who survives finds their neural pathways burned out and unable to move.

Ahab is a cyborg. His limbs are mostly of artificial construction and presumably this makes him superhumanly strong. So far he has found no need to engage in hand-to-hand combat due to his ability to use ranged attacks, his Hounds, and giant androids. He is largely immune to telepathic intrusion and attack, even from telepaths as powerful as [[Rachel Summers]]. Ahab's technology allows him to track, clothe and control [[Hounds (comics)|Hounds]].

As Famine, Ahab drains his victims' lifeforce resulting in emaciation and worse.
