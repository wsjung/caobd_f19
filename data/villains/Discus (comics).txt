The youngest son of Tyler Stuart, a warden at Seagate prison, Tim Stuart was employed by [[Justin Hammer]] and given a costume, jet-pack, and assorted weaponry. He took the name Discus, as his weapon of choice was a throwing disc; he usually carried disc-shaped flying blades. The younger brother of [[Stiletto (comics)|Stiletto]], he was most often partnered, and rarely went on his own missions. Like Stiletto, he was a constant thorn in [[Luke Cage]]'s side, but he also battled the [[Heroes for Hire]], the [[Daughters of the Dragon]], and [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]].<ref>''Power Man'' #22</ref><ref>''Power Man and Iron Fist'' #50</ref> Much later, both Stiletto and Discus were seen in Justin Hammer's employ. Attempting to capture [[Iron Man]], Stiletto and Discus attacked but were easily defeated after their weapons were unable to harm him.<ref>''Iron Man'' #126-127</ref> He and his brother, while imprisoned, found religion, but soon reverted to their old ways and began working for [[Nightshade (Marvel Comics)|Deadly Nightshade]]. However, as Stiletto continued on in his criminal career, Discus has not been seen for quite some time.<ref>''Power Man and Iron Fist'' #110</ref>

A partnership began with the [[Sphinx (comics)|Sphinx]] and Justin Hammer brought Discus back to villainy. Along with Hammer's villain army, Discus battled [[Nova (Richard Rider)|Nova]] and [[Namorita]], but he was defeated by both of them.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man Annual'' #12</ref><ref>''Web of Spider-man Annual'' #8</ref>
