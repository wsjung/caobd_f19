'''Warstar''' is a fictional character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].

==Fictional character biography==
Warstar is a warrior serving in the Royal Elite of the [[Shi'ar]] [[Imperial Guard (comics)|Imperial Guard]]. Warstar is actually two symbiotically linked sentient mechanoids, a small one named B'nee who can generate electricity and a large one named C’cil who is gigantic and immensely strong and durable. B'nee rides on C'cil's back.

Warstar joined in the Imperial Guard's trial by combat with the [[X-Men]] to decide the fate of the [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #137</ref> Warstar was then a traitor who served [[Lord Samedar]], [[Deathbird]], and the [[Brood (comics)|Brood]] in their conspiracy to overthrow Shi'ar Princess-Majestrix [[Lilandra Neramani|Lilandra]], and battled the X-Men.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #157</ref> On Deathbird's behalf, Warstar battled [[Ch'od]] of the [[Starjammers]].<ref>''X-Men Spotlight On: Starjammers'' #2</ref> Warstar was later back with the Imperial Guard, which was now serving Deathbird; he was defeated along with the other Imperial Guardsmen by the X-Men and Starjammers.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #275</ref>

During ''Operation Galactic Storm'', Warstar fought [[Captain America]] in Arizona in an attempt to abduct [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]].<ref>''Captain America'' #398</ref> Warstar battled Captain America, [[Iron Man]], and [[Wonder Man]] during the [[Kree/Shi'ar War|Kree-Shi'ar War]].<ref>''Avengers West Coast'' #80</ref> Warstar was defeated by [[Forgotten One (comics)|Gilgamesh]] and [[She-Hulk]].<ref>''Avengers West Coast'' #81</ref> Alongside the Imperial Guard, Warstar then confronted [[Quasar (Wendell Vaughn)|Quasar]].<ref>''Quasar'' #33</ref>

Warstar and fellow Guardsmen [[Hussar (comics)|Hussar]], [[Neutron (Marvel Comics)|Neutron]], and Webwing were discharged (for complicity in Deathbird's coup, after Lilandra was restored to the throne) and sent to Earth, which had been turned into an intergalactic prison planet in the [[Maximum Security (comics)|Maximum Security]] crossover.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #387, December 2000</ref>  The quartet joined with a rogue [[D'Bari]] in an attack on several X-Men, but were ultimately defeated.  When the Maximum Security storyline resolved, all alien prisoners were removed from Earth, <ref>''Maximum Security'' #3, January 2001</ref> and Warstar and certain others exiled to Earth have since been seen among the Imperial Guard again.{{Issue|date=June 2009}}

Warstar was ripped in half when the Guard fought for their new emperor [[Vulcan (Marvel Comics)|Vulcan]] against the X-Men and Starjammers, but Warstar survived and were carried away by their fellow Guardsmen.{{Issue|date=June 2009}}

During the [[War of Kings|war]] between Vulcan's regime and the [[Inhumans|Inhuman]]-ruled [[Kree]] Empire, Warstar was seen menacing [[Nova Corps]] Centurions on the Kree planet Kaiphas, but was stopped by Nova Prime [[Nova (Richard Rider)|Richard Rider]].  Both B'nee and C'cil were apparently decapitated by the Nova Prime, with B'nee's head completely missing and C'cil's reduced to a smoking mass.<ref>''Nova'' vol. 4, #26 (June 2009)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Warstar is actually a mechanoid symbiote of two separate beings, B'nee and C'cil. B'nee rides in a cavity on C'cil's back. B'nee and C'cil appear to communicate through a means that may be telepathic. B'nee and C'cil are empathically linked so that when B'nee feels pain, so does C'cil. Due to his low intellect, C'cil relies on B'nee to guide him in combat. B'nee can electrically shock an opponent with his touch, and C'cil possesses superhuman strength and durability.

Warstar is trained in armed and unarmed combat by the Shi'ar Imperial Guard, and uses a small Imperial Guard anti-gravity device which allows flight.

==Beany and Cecil==
They are named for the puppets [[Beany and Cecil]].{{Fact|date=December 2007}} In ''[[West Coast Avengers]]'' #80 (part two of ''[[Operation: Galactic Storm]]''), [[Iron Man]] sarcastically asks if they come from a moon called "Leakin' Luna", referring to the ''Leakin' Lena'' in the Beany and Cecil series.<ref>''[[West Coast Avengers]]'' #80</ref>

==In other media==
===Television===
* In the ''[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men]]'' TV series, Warstar appears in ''The Phoenix Saga'' and ''The Dark Phoenix Saga'' alongside the rest of the Imperial Guard.{{cn|date=February 2019}}

===Video games===
* Warstar appears as a mini-boss in ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance]]'', voiced by [[John Cygan]].{{cn|date=November 2017}} He appears on the Shi'ar warship and fights the heroes alongside [[Starbolt]]. A simulation disk has [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] trying to prevent Warstar from blowing up the [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] Omega base. He does not speak much when he and Starbolt fight the heroes, but speaks a lot during Wolverine's simulation disk.

==Inspiration==
Several of the members of the Imperial Guard are at least partly based on members of the [[DC Comics]] team [[Legion of Super-Heroes]].{{Fact|date=June 2009}} (Dave Cockrum, co-creator of the Guard, also had a long run as artist on the Legion). While Warstar does not seem to have a true analogue in the LSH, he may be inspired by LSH member [[Duo Damsel]], who could split herself in two.{{Fact|date=June 2009}}
