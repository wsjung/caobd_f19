'''Joanna Cargill''', also known as '''Frenzy''', is a [[fiction]]al [[character (arts)|character]], a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] [[superhuman]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. She has been a member of [[supervillain]] groups, including the [[Alliance of Evil]] and the [[Acolytes (comics)|Acolytes]], as well as the [[superhero]] team the [[X-Men]].

==Publication history==
{{Expand section|date=March 2011}}
Frenzy first appeared in ''[[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]'' #4 (May 1986) as a member of the [[Alliance of Evil]], and was created by [[Bob Layton]] and [[Keith Pollard]].

Though Joanna Cargill's first and last name have been spelled with variations such as Johanna or Cargil, her name was first mentioned in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #298 as Joanna Cargill. Frenzy should not be confused with another Joanna Cargill, a columnist introduced in ''Marvel Comics Presents'' #27.

During a March 2, 2011 Marvel Comics Liveblog, it was revealed that Frenzy is joining ''X-Men: Legacy'' in 2011 as a member of Rogue's team of X-Men, alongside Professor X, Magneto, Legion, and Gambit.<ref>http://marvel.com/news/story/15282/tune_in_to_year_of_the_x-men_liveblogs</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
The woman who would one day become the super-powered mutant, Frenzy, began her life as a battered child in an abusive household. Her father, an officer in the Armed Forces, despised her from birth not only because of her gender - he instead doted on his son in whom, according to Cargill, he saw a continuation of the family legacy as soldiers - but also because she was born prematurely, and was a sickly, frail child, greatly increasing the financial burdens on the family. Her mother, meanwhile, was thoroughly cowed by her husband's abuse, and did nothing to stop the beatings he would constantly inflict on his daughter for even seemingly minor infractions. One day, not long after his son was killed in action, he took his rage out on his daughter for the death of his son, seemingly wanting to beat her to death. Either her rage or her fear awakened her mutant powers as he beat her savagely, and she unintentionally punched straight through his body with a single blow, killing him instantly. Shocked at what she had done, albeit accidentally, she ran away from home.<ref>''X-Men: Legacy,'' vol. #1, #268, June 2012</ref>

===Alliance of Evil===
Originally a freelance mercenary, Frenzy joins together with three other mutants — [[Tower (comics)|Tower]], [[Stinger (comics)|Stinger]], and [[Timeshadow]] — under the employ of [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]], calling themselves the [[Alliance of Evil]].  After Tower's failed attempt to kidnap the mutant [[Rusty Collins]], Frenzy is sent and put in direct conflict with [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]].  Frenzy is unable to convince Rusty to join the Alliance, and fled after suffering defeat from X-Factor.  The Alliance later reveals they had a power-enhancing accomplice named Michael Nowlan.  After he tries to escape from the Alliance, the group threatens to kill Nowlan's girlfriend, Suzy.  X-Factor interferes in the Alliance's plans, eventually defeating them and putting them into custody.<ref>''X-Factor'' #4-5</ref>  Frenzy and the others inevitably break out, opposing the [[Registration acts (comics)#Mutant Registration Act|Mutant Registration Act]], but were defeated by the [[Beast (comics)|Beast]].<ref>''X-Factor'' #6</ref>

After another mission battling the [[New Mutants]] alongside the Alliance, Frenzy is defeated by [[Warpath (comics)|Warpath]].  [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] frees Frenzy and questions who had hired her.  She admits to being hired by [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] to bodyguard Harness and [[Piecemeal (Gilbert Benson)|Piecemeal]].

She eventually receives an invitation to join [[Superia]]'s [[Femizons]] and accepted, joining the superhuman women aboard Superia's cruise-ship.

===Acolytes===
Frenzy eventually found acceptance under [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]]'s teachings, joining the ranks of the second incarnation of the [[Acolytes (comics)|Acolytes]]. As was common among the Acolytes, she relinquished her codename, preferring to be called by her last name, Cargill. Their first mission was to capture a child with latent mutant powers from Our Mother of the Sacred Heart, a school. During the mission, Cargill killed [[Sharon Friedlander]], and with her teammates [[Unuscione]] and the [[Kleinstocks]], battled the gold [[X-Men]] team. Having history with [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]] (they met and clashed during a mission when they were mercenaries-for-hire), she immediately went after him and [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]]. However, Gambit was able to defeat her by hitting her with a kinetically charged tire.<ref>"Uncanny X-Men" #298</ref> (The hinted relationship between Cargill and Gambit was supposedly going to be elaborated on in [[Fabian Nicieza]]'s ''Gambit'' series, but it was canceled before he could get around to it.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}) The Acolytes were able to retreat, but fought the X-Men once again later that week.{{Issue|date=March 2010}} Cargill then battled [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]], commenting on how she has changed since her days with the Alliance of Evil, but Iceman was able to knock her unconscious using his newly acquired ice powers.{{Issue|date=March 2010}} Later, Cargill attempted to murder [[Robert Kelly (comics)|Senator Kelly]], but was electrocuted by [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Wolfsbane]].{{Issue|date=March 2010}}

After Magneto was revealed to be alive, Cargill was among the Acolytes who quickly turned on [[Fabian Cortez]] and joined Magneto in his mutant sanctuary, [[Providence (comics)#Avalon: Magneto's Acolytes' space station|Avalon]].{{Issue|date=March 2010}} While on a mission to recruit mutants to their cause, Cargill, along with [[Milan (comics)|Milan]] and Unuscione, found the young, meek boy [[Neophyte (comics)|Neophyte]].{{Issue|date=March 2010}} After his betrayal of the Acolytes, Cargill was quick to vote guilty at his trial.{{Issue|date=March 2010}} During the Fall of Avalon, Cargill allied herself with long-time enemy [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] in order to survive, and she and her fellow Acolytes were able to escape the destroyed space station in time. They crash landed in [[Australia]] but were given to the authorities.{{Issue|date=March 2010}}

The Acolytes escaped prison and found the remains of Avalon, worshipping it and the return of Magneto.{{Issue|date=March 2010}} [[Exodus (comics)|Exodus]] eventually took over leadership of the Acolytes, and Cargill participated in the attack on [[Wundagore|Mount Wundagore]], the [[High Evolutionary]]'s base of operations.{{Issue|date=March 2010}}

===Mind-controlled===
After the Acolytes disbanded, Cargill became the ambassador of [[Genosha]] to the [[United Nations]] and served as Magneto's right-hand woman.<ref name="mnyc">{{cite book | last = Sanderson | first = Peter | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = The Marvel Comics Guide to New York City | publisher = [[Pocket Books]] | year = 2007 | location = New York City | pages = 49–51 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 1-4165-3141-6}}</ref>  When the Avengers infiltrated Genosha, Cargill attacked [[She-Hulk]]   with a punch that sent She-Hulk flying.  After confronting [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] over his choices with his father, Cargill was defeated by [[Scarlet Witch]].  Later, Cargill appeared on television, ordering that every country pledge loyalty to Magneto in order to be given some autonomy.  She was eventually captured by the government in an attempt to find out more of Magneto's plans, but she refused to speak.  [[Jean Grey]] freed Cargill and mind-controlled her.  Cargill's knowledge of Genosha helped the X-Men find Magneto's base.  The inexperienced X-Men attacked but were quickly defeated.  Cargill was used against her will to battle Magneto, but she was ultimately constrained with a metal pillar.  After Magneto's defeat, Cargill was freed from her mind-control, where she immediately left the [[X-Mansion]].{{Issue|date=March 2010}}

She was stopped by Magneto, who used a surgical laser on Frenzy's eye to fry her brain.  While Xavier thought she was dead, Magneto revealed she is most likely alive.  Exodus, upon learning of this, swore to destroy Magneto.{{Issue|date=June 2009}}
