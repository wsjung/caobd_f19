==Fictional character biography==
Janice Lincoln is the daughter of the super powered mobster [[Tombstone (comics)|Tombstone]]. Janice's mother was an ex-girlfriend of Tombstone during his early days in organized crime. Janice grew with a semi regular life with Tombstone showing up sporadically, usually to help out with bills and schooling. Janice idolized her father and his criminal activities, but was forbidden to take part in them. After building a successful career as a defense attorney, she was appointed to defend Baron Zemo, at which point she volunteered to work for him as the new Beetle. Janice's armor is also revealed to have been built by the [[Fixer (comics)|Fixer]].<ref name="Superior Foes of Spider-Man #7">''Superior Foes of Spider-Man'' #7</ref> [[Helmut Zemo|Baron Helmut Zemo]] and the [[Fixer (comics)|Fixer]] provided Janice with the Beetle armor and a nano-virus as part of their plan to destroy the new Captain America. The new female Beetle is seen at the end of ''Captain America'' #606. She emerges from the rubble of an explosion she causes to confront Captain America (Bucky) and Black Widow.<ref>{{Cite comic

She is imprisoned in [[Raft (comics)|The Raft]], where she reveals that she knows Captain America and Bucky are one and the same. While Janice resists Bucky and the Widow's attempts to interrogate her for the identity of her employer, the Fixer asks Zemo whether they should punish her for her failure. Zemo is merciful, saying that she knows no information that would hurt them. Janice is left to her own devices, and the heroes still manage to piece together Zemo's identity. However, Zemo still exposes Captain America's true identity to the general public.<ref>{{Cite comic

As part of the ''[[Marvel NOW!]]'' event, she is now a member of Boomerang's [[Sinister Six]]. After being defeated by [[The Superior Spider-Man|Superior Spider-Man]] ([[Doctor Octopus]]' mind in [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]]'s body), Boomerang is secretly contracted by the Chameleon to recover the head of former [[Maggia (comics)|Maggia]] leader [[Silvermane]] from the [[Owl (Marvel Comics)|Owl]]. To this end, Boomerang deceives the team into agreeing to help him. However, after the original Beetle, the reformed Abe Jenkins, is assigned to be Boomerang's parole officer, the team vote him out and Janice as their new team leader. Speed Demon's vote is motivated by his unrequited attraction for her. The others note that the Beetle becomes more despotic as team leader, but attribute this as a reaction to the pressure to succeed and avoid incarceration. Boomerang secretly notifies Power Man and Iron Fist of the Sinister Six's whereabouts. Janice and her teammates are arrested, but Boomerang frees them in transit to jail and reclaims his leadership role. In this appearance, her first name is revealed to be Janice.<ref>''[[The Superior Spider-Man]]'' #1</ref>

After assaulting the Owl's base the Beetle, Overdrive and Speed Demon were captured by the villain and interrogated. The Beetle tried to blackmail the Owl into releasing them while covertly dialing for back-up. Unimpressed, the Owl got ready to execute her when reinforcements arrived in the form of Tombstone, where it is later revealed that she is his daughter.<ref>''Superior Foes of Spider-Man'' #6</ref>

Janice appears at [[Stark Industries]] after the events of ''[[The Superior Foes of Spider-Man]]'', claiming to have reformed, and applying for the open Head of Security position alongside [[Prodigy (David Alleyne)|Prodigy]], [[Victor Mancha]], and [[Ant-Man (Scott Lang)|Scott Lang]]. After seducing [[Iron Man]], Janice tries to assassinate him at the behest of an unidentified client, but she is disarmed by Lang, and pursued and presumably apprehended by Iron Man.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Nick Spencer|penciller = Ramon Rosanas|inker = Ramon Rosanas|colorist = Jordan Boyd|letterer = VC's Travis Lanham|editor = Wil Moss|story = Second-Chance Man: Part 1|title = Ant-Man|volume = 2|issue = #1|date = 7 January 2015|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref>

During the "Last Days" part of the ''[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]'' storyline, Janice appears in [[Miami]] where she and a despondent Lang have a drunken tryst as the world is destroyed by the final Incursions between Earth-616 and Earth-1610.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Nick Spencer|penciller = Ramon Rosanas|inker = Ramon Rosanas|colorist = Jordan Boyd|letterer = VC's Travis Lanham|editor = Wil Moss|title = Ant-Man: Last Days|volume = 1|issue = #1|date = 26 August 2015|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref>

Janice Lincoln appeared in the courthouse as a lawyer representing [[Mysterio]] following his failed alien invasion plot.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Nick Spencer|penciller = Ryan Ottley|inker = Cliff Rathburn|colorist = Laura Martin|letterer = Joe Caramagna|editor = Nick Lowe and Kathleen Wisneski|title = Amazing Spider-Man|volume = 5|issue = #1|date = 11 July 2018|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The Beetle suit grants superhuman strength and durability, allows the wearer to fly and stick to walls. Janice's armor seems to be loosely based on the armor designed by the [[Tinkerer]] for Abe Jenkins after his original Beetle armor was destroyed by Iron Man. However, the Zemo/Fixer costume does not seem to have the electro-byte offensive capability or the internal battle computer of Jenkins' suit. In her initial appearance, she uses military-grade weaponry to ambush Bucky and the Black Widow.

==In other media==
Janice Lincoln is featured as a boss in Spec Ops 31 of ''[[Marvel: Avengers Alliance]]''.<ref>[https://twitter.com/MAAInsiders/status/667842463336284161]</ref>
