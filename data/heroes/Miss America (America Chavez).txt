When America was approximately six-years-old, the Utopian Parallel was threatened by destruction. America's mothers sacrificed themselves to seal the black holes resulting in their particles being smeared across the Multiverse itself.<ref name="americaeverything"/> Wanting to prove herself as a hero and knowing Utopia didn't require salvation, America ran away from her home and her responsibilities.<ref>''Young Avengers'' (vol. 2) #3</ref><ref>''Young Avengers'' (vol. 2) #14.
