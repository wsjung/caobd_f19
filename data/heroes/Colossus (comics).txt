'''Colossus''' is a fictional [[superhero]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. He is the alter ego of '''Piotr''' "'''Peter'''" '''Nikolayevich Rasputin''' ([[Russian language|Russian]]: Пётр Николаевич Распутин). Created by writer [[Len Wein]] and artist [[Dave Cockrum]], he first appeared in ''[[Giant-Size X-Men]]'' #1 (May [[1975 in comics|1975]]).

A [[Russia]]n [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]], he is a member of the [[X-Men]]. Colossus is able to transform himself into metallic form, making him the physically strongest of the team. Even when his powers are not engaged, he is still a physically imposing figure of {{convert|6|ft|7|in|cm|sigfig=2|abbr=on}}. He is portrayed as quiet, honest and virtuous. He has had a fairly consistent presence in X-Men-related [[comic book]]s since his debut. A talented artist, he only reluctantly agrees to use his powers in combat, feeling it is his responsibility to use his abilities for the betterment of human- and mutant-kind.

''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]'' ranked Colossus at 184 on the "Top 200 Comic Book Characters of All Time".<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.wizarduniverse.com/051308top200characters2.html| website= WizardUniverse.com| date= May 13, 2008| title= The 200 Greatest Comic Book Characters Of All Time, Part 2| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080603030126/http://www.wizarduniverse.com/051308top200characters2.html| archivedate= June 3, 2008| accessdate= March 22, 2016}}</ref> In 2006, [[IGN]] placed Colossus in the 10th spot of their list of "The Top 25 X-Men".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2006/05/15/the-top-25-x-men?page=4 | title=The Top 25 X-Men | date=May 15, 2006 | work=IGN | publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] | accessdate=July 28, 2015}}</ref> In 2013, [[ComicsAlliance]] ranked Colossus as #22 on their list of the "50 Sexiest Male Characters in Comics".<ref>{{cite web|last=Wheeler |first=Andrew |url=http://comicsalliance.com/comics-sexiest-male-characters |title=ComicsAlliance Presents The 50 Sexiest Male Characters in Comics |publisher=[[ComicsAlliance]] |date=2013-02-14 |accessdate=2015-07-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151018024021/http://comicsalliance.com/comics-sexiest-male-characters |archivedate=2015-10-18 |df= }}</ref>

In film, actor [[Daniel Cudmore]] portrays Colossus in ''[[X2 (film)|X2]]'', ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]'' and ''[[X-Men: Days of Future Past]]'', and [[Stefan Kapičić]] provides the voice of a [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] character in ''[[Deadpool (film)|Deadpool]]'' and ''[[Deadpool 2]]''.

==Concept and creation==
Editor [[Roy Thomas]], in charge of reviving the X-Men for ''[[Giant-Size X-Men]]'' #1 (May [[1975 in comics|1975]]), told the creative team to go home and create some characters for the new team. [[Dave Cockrum]] recalled:<blockquote>
I just went home and Colossus was one of the first ones that came to mind. We needed a strong guy for the team, so I drew up a strong guy. The character's armor just kind of fell into place. He was accepted pretty much as-is, except that I had given him bare legs because it seemed only logical that if we're going to show him armored up, the legs should be bare like the arms. But [[Len Wein]] didn't like male characters with bare legs. So we decided that his costume would be blue when he wasn't armored up, and that we'd see his legs when he was armored up, due to the unstable molecules of his costume.<ref name="TyphoonDave">{{cite news | last = Meth | first= Clifford | date = August 1993 | title = How a Typhoon Blew in Success | work = [[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]: X-Men Turn Thirty | issue = | pages = 50–52}}</ref></blockquote>

==Publication history==
{{Expand section|date=September 2008}}
A mainstay of the X-Men comic book series until the 1990s, Colossus went on to appear regularly in the first series of ''[[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]]''. While a member of the team, he had his own self-titled one-shot that depicted him and his teammate [[Meggan]] battling [[Arcade (Marvel Comics)|Arcade]] at his new Murderworld facility.

After returning to the X-Men alongside Excalibur teammates [[Kitty Pryde|Shadowcat]] and [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]], Colossus stayed with the title until his death. He was later resurrected and was a regular in the third series of ''[[Astonishing X-Men]]'' written by [[Joss Whedon]]. He is the feature of a limited series, ''Colossus: Bloodlines'', in which he journeys back to Russia. Colossus has since returned as a regular in the X-Men series, appearing in various titles such as ''[[X-Men: Manifest Destiny]]'', ''[[Secret Invasion|X-Men: Secret Invasion]]'', ''[[X-Men (vol. 3)|X-Men]]'', and ''Astonishing X-Men''.

Colossus appears in ''[[Cable and X-Force]]'', a new series by writer Dennis Hopeless and artist [[Salvador Larroca]] which debuted in December 2012.<ref name="Cable&X-Force">{{cite web |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=40999 |title=EXCLUSIVE: The Future is Hopeless for "Cable and X-Force" |last=Richards |first=Dave |date=14 September 2012 |publisher=Comic Book Resources |accessdate= 14 September 2012}}</ref> He appears in ''[[Extraordinary X-Men]]'', written by Jeff Lemire and drawn by Humberto Ramos. He is part of a team which is led by Storm, and includes his sister [[Magik (Illyana Rasputin)|Magik]], [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]], a teenaged version of [[Jean Grey]], Nightcrawler, a re-purposed [[Sentinel (Marvel Comics)|Sentinel]] named Cerebra, and [[Old Man Logan]].

==Fictional character biography==

=== Background ===
[[File:Piotr Saving Sister.jpg|thumb|250px|Colossus' first appearance from ''[[Giant-Size X-Men]]'' #1 (May 1975); art by [[Dave Cockrum]]]]
Piotr "Peter" Rasputin was born on a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Collective farming|collective farm]] called the [[Ust-Ordynsky]] Collective near [[Lake Baikal]] in [[Siberia]]. He lived there with his mother Alexandra, father Nikolai, and sister [[Magik (Illyana Rasputin)|Illyana]]. His older brother, [[Mikhail Rasputin|Mikhail]], had been a Soviet [[Astronaut|cosmonaut]] and had apparently died in a rocket accident. The 2006 comic mini-series ''Colossus: Bloodline'' established that the family was descended from [[Grigori Rasputin]].

Peter's superhuman powers manifested during his adolescence while saving his sister from a runaway tractor. He was then contacted by [[Professor X|Professor Charles Xavier]], founder of the X-Men.<ref name="debut"/>

===X-Men===
Peter Rasputin was part of the second generation of X-Men, formed by Charles Xavier to save the original X-Men from the living island [[Krakoa]]. He agreed to leave the farm community where he was born to go to the United States with Xavier. Xavier gave him the name Colossus. After the battle was won, Colossus remained in the U.S. with the new X-Men.<ref name="debut">''Giant-Size X-Men'' #1</ref>

[[File:Colossus Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 19.png|thumbnail|upright|Colossus in his non-metallic form. From ''[[Astonishing X-Men]]'' vol. 3, #19 (February 2007); art by John Cassaday]]
Colossus is typically portrayed as peaceful, selfless, reluctant to hurt or kill, and often putting himself in danger to protect others. In some of his earliest missions, he battled the [[Shi'ar]] [[Imperial Guard (comics)|Imperial Guard]],<ref>''X-Men'' (vol. 1) #107</ref> and visited the [[Savage Land]],<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #114</ref> where he met Nereel.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #115</ref>

Peter's family always remained in his thoughts and he frequently wrote letters home. Shortly after joining the X-Men, a woman known as [[Miss Locke]] kidnapped many of the team's loved ones to force the X-Men to help her free her employer, [[Arcade (Marvel Comics)|Arcade]], from captivity by one of [[Doctor Doom]]'s robots. Among her captives was Colossus' younger sister Illyana, whom Locke had kidnapped from the Siberian collective farm and transported to the United States. Arcade brainwashed Colossus into becoming "The Proletarian", who then battled the other X-Men until they countered the brainwashing.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #123–124</ref> The X-Men freed Illyana from captivity, and she went to live with her brother Peter at [[X-Mansion|Xavier's mansion]]. She was later held captive in a dimension known as [[Otherplace|Limbo]], where she spent years while only mere moments elapsed on Earth, and became the adolescent sorceress Magik. As a result, an alternate-timeline version of Colossus dies in Limbo.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #160</ref>

When the X-Men fought the evil mutant [[Proteus (Marvel Comics)|Proteus]], Colossus attempted to kill Proteus, an act he found morally questionable even though he did it to save [[Moira MacTaggart]]'s life.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #128–129</ref> During his early career with the X-Men, Peter started what was arguably his most significant relationship with fellow X-Man [[Kitty Pryde]].<ref>they met in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #129</ref> Although they were only a couple for a short while, the relationship provided the foundation of a deep and lasting friendship.

Colossus was later almost killed in a battle with [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]]'s [[Brotherhood of Mutants]], but was saved by [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] and the [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlock]] [[Healer (comics)|Healer]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #177–179</ref> During the [[Secret Wars]], he became infatuated with the alien healer Zsaji,<ref>''Secret Wars'' #5–12</ref> and realized his feelings for his teammate were not wholly genuine, ending his relationship with Kitty Pryde.<ref name="KitBreakup"/> Emotionally distraught, he afterwards engaged in a bar fight with [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]].<ref name="KitBreakup">''Uncanny X-Men'' #183</ref>

During the [[Mutant Massacre]], Colossus became heavily involved in the X-Men's efforts to save the Morlocks from the [[Marauders (comics)|Marauders]]. When Kitty was severely injured by [[Harpoon (comics)|Harpoon]], Peter gave in to his rage and snapped [[Riptide (comics)|Riptide]]'s neck.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #211</ref> He eventually passed out from previous wounds inflicted by Riptide. [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]], with the aid of Shadowcat, used his powers to heal Peter's armored form, but the process left him paralyzed. He was sent to Muir Island to recuperate, along with Nightcrawler, Shadowcat, and the surviving Morlocks.

Over time, Colossus' wounds healed, but he was trapped in his armoured form and could maintain his human form only with the utmost concentration. When he saw the X-Men in Dallas during the ''[[Fall of the Mutants]]'', he had his sister teleport him to the battle, as [[Destiny (Irene Adler)|Destiny]] had not seen him in her vision of the X-Men's demise. When the team decided to sacrifice themselves to stop the Adversary, Colossus gave his life alongside them to save the world. Like the rest of the X-Men, he was revived by Roma and decided to let the world believe him dead while he and the X-Men worked out of an Australian base.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #227</ref>

Following the ''[[Inferno (Marvel Comics)|Inferno]]'' event, Illyana was returned to her original Earth age.<ref>''The New Mutants'' #73</ref> Colossus decided it would be better for Illyana if she went back to live with their parents in Russia.

In time, Colossus was reunited with Nereel in the Savage Land, and met her son.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men Annual'' #12</ref>

After the X-Men began falling apart with [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] vanishing, [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] taking off, [[Longshot (Marvel Comics)|Longshot]] quitting, and Storm apparently killed, [[Psylocke]] telepathically prodded the remaining three to disband and travel through the [[Siege Perilous (comics)|Siege Perilous]] to gain new lives.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #231</ref> Peter emerged in New York with no memory of his past life, inventing a new persona for himself as 'Peter Nicholas', where he quickly became a successful artist. He battled the [[Genosha]]n Magistrates.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #259</ref> He began having visions of a beautiful model, who turned out to be [[Callisto (comics)|Callisto]] transformed by [[Masque (comics)|Masque]]. The two were kidnapped by the Morlocks, though Peter had no memory of his time with the X-Men.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #262</ref> He resumed his armored form and defeated Masque.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #263</ref> He was saved by [[Forge (comics)|Forge]], [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]], and [[Jean Grey]], who decided it better that he live his new life rather than be dragged back into theirs.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #264</ref>

Peter was psychically dominated by the [[Shadow King]] and sent to hunt down [[Stevie Hunter]] and Charles Xavier.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #277</ref> Xavier had no choice but to destroy the Peter Nicholas persona to break the Shadow King's hold.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #279</ref> Colossus joined in the battle of Muir Island, and rejoined the X-Men as a member of Storm's Gold Strike Force.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #280</ref> Peter is shown to be traveling to the Savage Land, where he locates Nereel. He is astonished to learn that the child she bore was not his, but that of another lover. Disheartened, he departs the Savage Land.{{issue|date=November 2011}}

The X-Men later found themselves in another dimension, where they discovered that Colossus' brother, Mikhail, was alive and acting as a [[messiah]] to the population of that world.{{Issue|date=April 2010}} Mikhail returned to Earth with the X-Men, but was distraught with having been responsible for the deaths of the original crew from his first trek into the other dimension.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men''(1st series) #284-286</ref>

Mikhail established himself as leader of the Morlocks and planned to use them as a part of his mass suicide which he thought would grant him retribution or at least reprieve from his guilt.{{issue|date=August 2016}} This would prove to be a great source of grief for Peter in an upcoming string of family deaths that would lead to him temporarily disbanding from the X-Men.{{issue|date=August 2016}}

However, unbeknownst to the X-Men, Mikhail survived. In a seemingly last second change of mind, Mikhail transported himself and the Morlocks to another world.{{issue|date=August 2016}} Later, upon learning this, Peter was disappointed by his brother's departure and blamed himself.{{issue|date=August 2016}}

Back in Siberia, Peter's parents were slain and Illyana kidnapped by the Russian government, who hoped to genetically evolve Illyana to the point where she would have the use of her powers again, to defeat the mutant known as the [[Soul Skinner]]. Colossus, with the help of the X-Men, saved Illyana and brought her back to the Mansion.<ref>''X-Men'' (vol. 2) #17 - 19(1992)</ref>

Later, Illyana became an early victim of the [[Legacy Virus]] and died from it.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #303 (August 1993)</ref> The loss of his immediate family, as well as brain damage that forced him to remain in armored form, caused Colossus to rethink his position with the X-Men and join [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] and his [[Acolytes (comics)|Acolytes]], who had offered him an alternative to the X-Men's [[Pacifism|pacifist]] philosophy of peaceful mutant/human coexistence.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #304</ref> Colossus recovered from the brain damage soon after,<ref>''Excalibur'' #71</ref> but decided to remain with the Acolytes of his own volition, hoping he could temper their extremist methods with what he had learned from Professor Xavier.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #315 (Aug 1994)</ref>

===Excalibur===
His stay with Magneto was not long once he realized that [[Providence (comics)|Avalon]] was not the place for him, either, particularly after Magneto was left brain-dead and the space station was destroyed by [[Holocaust (Marvel Comics)|Holocaust]].{{Issue|date=April 2009}} He left in search of the only person he felt truly cared for him, his former love and teammate [[Kitty Pryde|Shadowcat]], now a member of [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]]. Colossus traveled to England, where he found Kitty in the arms of her new love, [[Pete Wisdom]]. Colossus, exhausted, mentally ill, and enraged, attacked Wisdom and, although the battle was short, Piotr nearly killed him. Colossus was subdued by [[Captain Britain]] and [[Meggan]],<ref>''Excalibur'' (vol. 1) #92</ref> later cured of his illness by [[Moira MacTaggert]].{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

Colossus accepted Shadowcat's new life and chose to become a member of Excalibur.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} Although Colossus, along with the rest of the team, soon accepted Kitty's relationship with Wisdom, Kitty's pet dragon, Lockheed, did not, and was often seen trying to reunite Kitty with Peter, whom he much preferred. One such example being snatching away the garter during Meggan and Captain Britain's wedding and dropping it into Colossus' hand, who was then required to place it on Kitty's leg, who had previously caught the bride's flowers.<ref>''Excalibur'' #125 (1998)</ref> With Excalibur, he participated in many adventures, including helping to save London from an ancient demon.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} Excalibur eventually disbanded, and Colossus returned with Nightcrawler and Shadowcat to the X-Men. But as soon as they returned, they faced a group of [[Cerebro's X-Men|imposters]] following Cerebro, in the guise of Professor X.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' (vol. 1) #360</ref><ref>''X-Men'' (vol. 1) #80</ref> During this time, he repaired his friendships with [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] and [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], that were broken when he had joined the Acolytes.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} He formed a deep friendship with [[Marrow (comics)|Marrow]].{{Issue|date=April 2009}} Peter again found his long thought-dead brother [[Mikhail Rasputin|Mikhail]], but unfortunately lost him again when Apocalypse collected [[X-Men: The Twelve|The Twelve]] in his quest for power.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

===Death===
Using thoughts and notes from the recently murdered [[Moira MacTaggert]], the X-Men's resident scientist, [[Beast (comics)|Beast]], claimed to have found the cure for the Legacy Virus. Unfortunately, it could only be made airborne with the death of its first user. Rather than wait for a safer version and allow others to die as Illyana had, Colossus injected himself with the cure. By using his powers and sacrificing himself, Colossus enabled the release of an airborne cure, effectively eradicating the disease. His body was cremated, and Shadowcat took his ashes back to Russia to be scattered on his native soil.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #390</ref>

===Return===
[[File:Colossusreturn.jpg|upright|thumb|The return of Colossus in ''[[Astonishing X-Men]]'' #4; art by [[John Cassaday]]]]
Nearly two years later, it was brought to the attention of the X-Men that a medical company, entitled Benetech, had developed a mutant cure. After gaining a sample of the cure, Dr. Henry (Beast) McCoy discovered a string of [[DNA]] hidden deep within the recesses of the formula. After matching the DNA, Beast and the other X-Men set out to investigate the truth behind Benetech.

During their infiltration, they discovered that [[Ord (comics)|Ord]], an [[Extraterrestrial life in popular culture|alien]] from the Breakworld, was responsible for the means with which the company was able to develop the cure. While the team was separated, Kitty descended into a hidden complex beneath the Benetech building and was able to unlock the true secret behind the cure: shortly after Peter's self-sacrificing death, Ord had captured his body and left a duplicate that the X-Men had cremated.<ref name="Astonishing X-Men #4">''Astonishing X-Men'' #4</ref>

After reviving him, Ord had used the Legacy Virus cure in Peter's bloodstream to develop his mutant cure. After unknowingly releasing Peter from his cell, Kitty rejoined him with the X-Men. Together they subdued Ord as he tried to escape Earth. Since reuniting with his friends, Peter has returned to fight with the X-Men, and he and Kitty were able to resume their romantic relationship.<ref name= "Astonishing X-Men #4"/>

===Colossus: Bloodline===
During the ''Colossus: Bloodline'' limited series, Colossus made a trip to Russia in response to a call for help from his cousin, journalist Larisa Mishchenko. Her research had established that their family descended from [[Grigori Rasputin]], and that their relatives were being systematically murdered. Rasputin is established as having been a powerful mutant, whose power and life essence had been passed down to his descendants. As his descendants are murdered, his great power is invested in greater measure in the remaining descendants. When there is only one descendant left, Rasputin will be reborn within that individual. [[Mister Sinister]], an old ally of Rasputin, is revealed as the man behind the murders.{{issue|date=May 2017}}

Larisa is murdered by Sinister, but Colossus and his brother Mikhail foil Sinister's plot, and Mikhail banishes himself to a dimension where he can never die, but from which he can never return. If Sinister were to murder Colossus, Rasputin would be reborn in Mikhail, but locked in a dimension on his own. However, all those involved remained unaware of Colossus' son, Peter, in the [[Savage Land]], whose presence could severely alter the situation. Colossus returned to the X-Men, a man without family. It is rumoured that the boy ''Michael Termani'' escaped the extermination and made his way to the United States of America in search of Colossus, whom he may be related to.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

===Breakworld and beyond===
[[Image:AstonColossus.png|thumb|upright|Colossus in promotional art for the ''Astonishing X-Men'' vol. 3 story arc ''Unstoppable'' (2007); by John Cassaday]]
During an attack on the institute, Colossus engages [[Sebastian Shaw (comics)|Sebastian Shaw]], although "Shaw" turned out to be an illusory attack by [[Cassandra Nova]]. It was revealed that Colossus is the mutant destined to destroy [[Ord (comics)|Breakworld]] according to the Breakworld's precogs. However, on a mission to the Breakworld, the X-Men discover that this was not an actual prophecy but an elaborate scheme created by Aghanne, the insane leader of a Breakworld reform cult, intended to bring about that world's destruction. Colossus is chosen for the prophecy as his unique organic steel form would allow him to destroy the planet's power source, initiating a chain reaction that would destroy the entire world. Realizing this, Colossus refuses to kill the planet although he does threaten to seize power and rule it if the Breakworld destroys the Earth as planned.<ref>''Giant-Size Astonishing X-Men'' #1</ref>

During the "[[World War Hulk]]" storyline, Colossus is one of the X-Men members that tries to defend Professor X against the [[Hulk]], who has come looking for Charles as he is one of the members of the secret [[Illuminati (Marvel Comics)|Illuminati]] that exiled him from Earth. During their battle, the Hulk reflects on Colossus' bravery, mentioning that Colossus might have made a "decent opponent" to the Hulk's previous incarnations. Locked in a test of strength, Hulk demonstrates his superior power by bending Colossus's arms backwards at the forearms, breaking them.<ref>''World War Hulk: X-Men'' #2</ref> Beast later uses a laser in the lab to heat his arms up near their melting point, while [[Strong Guy]] bends them back into place; his arms needed to be re-set in their metal form before he transformed back to his human form to avoid serious injury to them.<ref>''World War Hulk: X-Men'' #3</ref>

Colossus returns to Russia with Wolverine and Nightcrawler along for the ride. The trio are captured by the Russian government, who wish to find out why all their mutant agents succumbed to M-Day, and Colossus did not. This led to a battle against the Russians and Omega Red, who was being examined by their captors. After defeating Omega Red, the heroes receive a call from Cyclops informing them of their new home in San Francisco. They soon arrive back in the States, where they aid in rebuilding the X-Men.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #495–499</ref>

Colossus was briefly a member of the [[Fifty State Initiative]] team called ''The Last Defenders'' alongside [[Nighthawk (Marvel Comics)#Nighthawk|Nighthawk]], [[She-Hulk]], and [[Blazing Skull]].<ref>''Last Defenders'' #1–3</ref>

Joining the rest of the X-Men, Colossus relocates to San Francisco.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #500</ref> Still mourning Kitty, the other X-Men try to cheer him up using various different methods from picking fights with him to throwing a party. In the end he tells them to leave him be, he just needs time. Later while walking through Golden Gate Park, he come across a little girl who needs help rescuing her ''Kitty'' from a tree to which he replies that nothing would make him happier.<ref>''X-Men: Manifest Destiny'' #3</ref>

===X-Infernus===
{{Main|X-Infernus}}
Colossus feels the X-Men are not doing enough to rescue Illyana from Limbo, and is upset.<ref>''X-Infernus'' #1</ref> With the aid of [[Pixie (X-Men)|Pixie]], the team is able to enter Limbo, where they encounter hostile demons.<ref>''X-Infernus'' #2</ref> After defeating the demons, the X-Men locate Illyana, who has been defeated by Witchfire.<ref>''X-Infernus'' #3</ref> The X-Men and Magik defeat Witchfire by trapping her in the dimension that houses the Elder Gods. Illyana leaves Limbo with the X-Men when [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] and Colossus offer her a home.<ref>''X-Infernus'' #4</ref>

===Utopia===
When the Dark Avengers head into San Francisco to battle any X-Men they can find, Colossus battles Venom.<ref>''Dark Avengers/Uncanny X-Men: Utopia'' and ''Uncanny X-Men'' #513</ref> They later face off again when the combined Dark Avengers and Dark X-Men attack Utopia, with Colossus and the X-Men emerging victorious.<ref>''Dark Avengers/Uncanny X-Men: Exodus''</ref> 
It's also during this time that Colossus suffers from depression due to the loss of Kitty prior to the Messiah Complex. During this period, Magik arrives at Utopia to ask for help from the X-Men and her former teammates as there's a battle coming in Limbo. The reunion helps alleviate some of Colossus's depression, but after Magneto comes to Utopia, Magneto brings the bullet carrying Kitty back to Earth to save her in a show of good faith and Kitty and Colossus are reunited, but are initially unable to touch as Kitty spent so long phased to stop the bullet hitting something that she has 'forgotten' how to resume a tangible state on her own.<ref>{{Cite comic| writer = [[Matt Fraction]]| penciller = [[Whilce Portacio]]| inker = Ed Tadeo| story = Ghostly| title = Uncanny X-Men| volume = 1| issue = 522| date = May 2010| publisher = Marvel Comics| location =| page =| panel =| id =}}</ref> Due to Warlord Krunn's mutant cure, Colossus was temporarily depowered and beaten in battle by him,<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #537</ref> but other Breakworld residents were able to restore Kitty to her fully tangible state.{{issue|date=June 2015}}

===Fear Itself===
[[File:Uncanny X-Men 543.jpg|upright|thumb|Colossus as the newly appointed [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]] on the cover of ''Uncanny X-Men'' #543 (September 2011). Art by [[Greg Land]].]]
After the [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]] became Kuurth: Breaker of Stone, one of the Heralds of a long-dormant god of fear known as the [[Serpent (comics)|Serpent]], Colossus made a bargain with [[Cyttorak]], the other-dimensional being who originally empowered the Juggernaut, to gain the power to stand against Kuurth. Colossus became the new avatar of the Juggernaut and was able to push Cain Marko back until Cain was summoned by The Serpent. This decision caused Kitty to break up with Colossus, as she cannot cope with his increasingly displayed willingness to sacrifice himself when she wants someone who will be willing to ''live'' for her.<ref name="Uncanny X-Men #542">''Uncanny X-Men'' #542</ref>

Due to this, Colossus decides to stay on Utopia with Cyclops' team of X-Men instead of returning to Westchester due to his fear of his new Juggernaut powers being unsafe around children.<ref>''X-Men Regenesis'' #1</ref> After another stressful battle, Colossus realized that his powers were far more dangerous than he realized, and he requested to be locked up alongside his sister, only to be freed when needed on missions.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' (vol. 2) #10</ref>

===Avengers vs. X-Men===
At the onset of the ''[[Avengers vs. X-Men]]'' storyline, Colossus is featured in fights against several characters, including [[Spider-Man]],<ref>''AVX: VS'' #2</ref> [[Thunderbolt Ross|Red Hulk]],<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' (vol. 2) #11</ref> and [[Thing (comics)|Thing]].<ref>''AVX: VS'' #3</ref> He is one of the few X-Men teleported by Magik to the dark side of the moon to confront the Avengers over [[Hope Summers (comics)|Hope Summers]]. When the disruptor devised by [[Iron Man]] blasts and divides the [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix Force]], part of it bonds to Colossus, who becomes one of the Phoenix Five along with Cyclops, Emma Frost, Magik and Namor.<ref>''Avengers vs. X-Men'' #5</ref> He attempts to release his Juggernaut powers, but Cyttorak refuses, citing his affiliation with the Phoenix due to his newfound destructive powers.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' (vol. 2) #15 (AvsX)</ref> While empowered with his fragment of the Phoenix Force, Colossus attempts to regain Kitty's affections, but she rejects him—wary of his power-mongering and that the Phoenix has changed him for the worse—he reacts angrily.<ref>''Wolverine and the X-Men'' #14 (July 2012)</ref> Colossus is eventually defeated when Spider-Man manages to provoke him and Magik into attacking each other, causing them to incapacitate each other. Their Phoenix powers dissipate and are absorbed by Emma Frost and Cyclops (Namor having already been defeated).<ref>''Avengers vs. X-Men'' #9</ref> Following the defeat of Cyclops as the last of the Phoenix Five, Colossus and the other former members of the Phoenix Five did not surrender themselves to the authorities.<ref>''Avengers vs. X-Men'' #12</ref> Magik later purges the Juggernaut powers from Colossus with her Soulsword.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Uncanny X-Men (vol. 2) #20 (AvsX)|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> Knowing that Magik could have repelled his servitude to Cyttorak at any time and that she made him keep the Juggernaut powers to teach him a lesson, Colossus evinces hatred toward the sister he once loved, going so far as to say he wants her killed.<ref>''AvX: Consequences'' #4</ref>

===X-Force===
Colossus's powers have gone out of control, apparently as a result of losing the Phoenix Force, causing parts of him to shift between flesh and organic steel rather than all flesh or all organic steel.<ref>''Cable and X-Force'' #2</ref> He now appears as a member of Cable's new X-Force team after Cable provides him with a device that stabilizes his condition.<ref>''Cable and X-Force'' #3</ref>

===Amazing X-Men===
Colossus has since rejoined Wolverine's team of X-Men after his sister convinced him to,<ref name="Amazing X-Men #6">''Amazing X-Men'' #6</ref> after quitting Cable's X-Force team following the results of the Cable and X-Force/Uncanny X-Force: Vendettas storyline.{{issue|date=July 2014}} It is eventually discovered that Cyclops, Emma Frost, Magik, Magneto and Colossus were actually infected with nano-sentinels by [[Dark Beast]], after the incident with the Phoenix Force, and that was the real cause for their broken powers.{{issue|date=February 2017}} He has since regained control of his organic steel powers and has stopped wearing Cable's harness which helped him to stabilize his flesh and steel forms.<ref name="Amazing X-Men #6"/>

During the ''[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]'' storyline, Colossus is with the X-Men when they take part in the incursion event between Earth-616 and Earth-1610. The Hulk's Doc Green form uses Colossus in a Fastball Special that destroys the [[Triskelion (comics)|Triskelion]].<ref>''Secret Wars'' #1</ref>

===Extraordinary X-Men===
Colossus later joins Storm's new team of X-Men who are living in an isolated part of [[Limbo (Marvel Comics)|Limbo]] after magically transporting the mansion there, renaming it [[X-Mansion#X-Haven|X-Haven]]. Their mission is to provide a refuge and protect mutants from the effects of the M-Pox that has infected the mutants and rendered almost all of the mutant species sterile due to the [[Terrigen]] in the atmosphere.{{issue|date=July 2016}} During the Apocalypse Wars, Colossus, Ernst, Anole, Glob Herman and No-Girl are separated from Storm's team. When they re-encounter the missing students, they discover them to be now adults protecting an ark of 600 artificially created mutant embryos from the Four Horsemen of Apocalypse: one of whom is a celestially altered Colossus.<ref>''Extraordinary X-Men'' #12</ref>

Colossus was eventually found by his teammates Iceman and Nightcrawler<ref>''Extraordinary X-Men'' #14</ref> and teleported back to X-Haven by Cerebra.<ref>''Extraordinary X-Men'' #15</ref> There, he was transformed back to normal by Apocalypse, who was tricked into doing so by Nightcrawler.<ref>''Extraordinary X-Men'' #16</ref>

===''Inhumans vs X-Men'' and ''X-Men Gold''===
After Beast discovers that there isn't a cure for the M-Pox and no way to alter the Terrigen cloud the X-Men are left with the choice to either stay on earth and fight for their right to live and risk becoming extinct in a matter of weeks or leave earth and start fresh somewhere else. The X-Men decide to go to [[Inhumans vs. X-Men|war against the]] [[Inhumans]] to decide the fate of the Terrigen. With the war underway Colossus is stationed at X-Haven to protect it from a potential Inhuman counter-attack. When the [[Inhuman Royal Family]] arrives to do just that, Colossus is left to face them on his own. He later joins the rest of the X-Men in Iceland in the final battle against the Inhumans, where [[Medusa (comics)|Medusa]] finally understands what the X-Men are fighting for so she voluntarily destroys the Terrigen.<ref>''Inhumans vs X-Men'' #0-6</ref>

After the Terrigen is destroyed the X-Men sends the refugees back home from X-Haven now that earth is habitable for mutants again. Still, the X-Men find themselves wondering how to move forward with the events of the war still fresh in their minds. Storm asks Kitty Pryde to return to the X-Men and take her place as leader, and in doing so Kitty moves the mansion from Limbo to Central Park and creates a new field team and recruits Colossus. Colossus and Kitty share many awkward moments given their history, trying to move forward as friends but still feeling a chemistry.<ref>''X-Men Gold'' #1-3</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Colossus is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] with the ability to transform his entire body into a form of "organic steel", with properties similar to [[osmium]] but of still unknown composition. Colossus must transform his entire body into this armored state; he cannot transform only a portion of his body. When he transforms, he gains approximately {{convert|1|ft|cm|abbr=on}} in height; official figures state his height at about {{convert|7|ft|5|in|cm|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} in transformed state versus {{convert|6|ft|6|in|cm|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} in normal human form) and his weight is at least doubled.<ref>''Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe'' (vol. 4) #19</ref> In his armored form, Colossus possesses superhuman levels of strength, as well as superhuman stamina and durability. His physical strength is currently greater than when he first joined the X-Men due to the realignment of his cells by Magneto following an injury during the [[Mutant Massacre]]. While in his armored form, Colossus requires no food, water, or even oxygen to sustain himself, and is extremely resistant to injury. He is capable of withstanding great impacts, large caliber bullets, falling from tremendous heights, electricity, and certain magical attacks.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #188</ref> While he has great resistance to temperature extremes of hot and cold, extreme heat followed by rapid super-cooling has been shown to cause extreme damage. As he is vulnerable to the anti-metal [[vibranium]] in his metal form, his body instinctively shifts to human form when faced with a vibranium weapon.<ref>''X-Men/Spider-Man'' #4</ref>

Colossus is an excellent hand-to-hand combatant, having been trained in [[Judo]] by [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' vol. 1 #121 (May 1979)</ref> He has had training in acrobatics and sword fighting<ref>''Excalibur'' vol. 1 #108 (April 1997)</ref> from [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]]. In his human form, he is still exceptionally strong and in superb physical condition, though not superhumanly so. He has completed college-level courses at Xavier's school.

As the unstoppable [[Juggernaut (comics)|Avatar of Cyttorak]], Colossus gained additional superhuman strength and resistance to injury, as well as other mystical powers. Among these is the power to ignore impediments to his movement, hence the "unstoppable" moniker.<ref name="Uncanny X-Men #542"/>
