'''Angela''' is a [[fictional character|fictional]]  [[comic book]] [[superhero]] created by author [[Neil Gaiman]] and artist [[Todd McFarlane]]. She first appeared as a supporting antagonist in McFarlane's creator-owned series ''[[Spawn (comics)|Spawn]]'', making her debut in issue #9 in March 1993, and later starring in her own self-titled miniseries. She is an angel and a bounty hunter, working under the auspices of Heaven to oppose Spawn.

Angela was later the subject of a legal battle between McFarlane and Gaiman over the rights to the character, which Gaiman won. Gaiman later sold the rights to the character to [[Marvel Comics]]; she was integrated into the Marvel Universe in the 2013 story "[[Age of Ultron]]", and her character was expanded upon in the 2014 storyline "[[Original Sin (comics)|Original Sin]]", where she was established to be the lost sister of [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]].

==Publication history==
Angela is a recurring adversary and sometimes ally of Spawn. Starting with her debut in issue #9 of the series ''Spawn'', she has made appearances in issues #62, #89, and #96 through #100.

In 1994 and 1995, a three-issue ''Angela'' [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] was published, written by Gaiman and illustrated by [[Greg Capullo]]. The series was later reprinted as a [[trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]] titled ''Angela Trade Paperback'', retitled as ''Spawn: Angela's Hunt'' in later printings and given a new cover design ({{ISBN|1-887279-09-1}}). {{As of|2005}}, the series is out-of-print. In 1995, an ''Angela'' stand-alone comic was also created.

Angela has also been featured in several [[fictional crossover|crossovers]]. The ''Rage of Angels'' miniseries saw Angela meeting [[Glory (comics)|Glory]] in ''Angela and Glory'' (1996), and was continued in ''[[Youngblood (comics)|Youngblood]]'' #6 (1996) and ''[[Team Youngblood]]'' #21. There was also a crossover called ''Aria/Angela'', in which she featured in the series ''[[Aria (comics)|Aria]]''.

[[Comic Book Resources]] confirmed on March 21, 2013 that Neil Gaiman was returning to [[Marvel Comics]] and would bring Angela with him. [[Joe Quesada]] was quoted as saying her first appearance as a proper Marvel character would happen at the finale of the ''[[Age of Ultron]]'' event.<ref name="CBR">{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=44385 |title=Gaiman Returns to Marvel, Brings ''Spawn's'' Angela |first=Steve |last=Sunu |date=March 21, 2013 |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6FLgameNK?url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=44385 |archivedate=March 24, 2013 |deadurl=no |accessdate=March 23, 2013 |quote=Later this year, writer Neil Gaiman makes his return to Marvel Comics...Perhaps even more intriguing is the announcement that Gaiman plans to introduce Angela to the Marvel U. }}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==

===Image Comics history===
[[File:Angela hunter.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Angela (as drawn by [[Greg Capullo]]) appearance in Image Comics, typical of the style of the early 1990s.]]Angela is an angel and a bounty hunter, working under the auspices of Heaven to oppose Spawn. She attempted to kill Spawn upon their first meeting, but was defeated despite her significantly greater experience. Later, he came to her aid during her trial in Heaven, where he testified that she had permission to kill him. They were temporarily trapped in a pocket dimension when Spawn's cloak acted to protect him from her weapons. Spawn's restructuring of reality allowed them to return from the pocket dimension, and also erased Angela's 'permit' to use her weapons against him. While returning to Earth they started a romantic relationship, however Angela was killed during the battle with [[Malebolgia]]. Spawn returned her body to the angels, who presumably brought her back to life.

===Marvel Comics history===
During the ''[[Age of Ultron]]'' storyline, Angela is revealed to be alive and has been pulled from Heaven <!-- This is not a misspelling; it is the canon spelling. --> as a result of [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]]'s damage to the Omniverse.<ref>''Age of Ultron'' #10</ref> In a combination of rage and confusion, she charges towards Earth from outer space, only to be intercepted by the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]], leading to her joining the team.<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' Vol. 3 #5</ref>

During the ''[[Original Sin (comics)|Original Sin]]'' storyline, it is revealed that she is Aldrif, the daughter of [[Odin (comics)|Odin]] and Freyja, making her sister to [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] and [[Loki (comics)|Loki]]. She was "killed" as an infant during Asgard's war with the Angels of the Tenth Realm called "Heven." This crime resulted in Odin severing the Tenth Realm from the other nine as punishment for their attack. Thor learns of his sister's existence when he is exposed to the secrets of [[Uatu]], the [[Watcher (comics)|Watcher]]'s eye, by the [[Orb (comics)|Orb]]. He returns to Asgard to confront his mother about his sister's existence, and subsequently travels to the Tenth Realm with Loki to learn more about his sister.<ref>''Original Sin'' #5.1</ref>

The Guardians of the Galaxy and Angela are attacked in warp space by a band of pirates, called Warpjackers. During the battle, Angela abandons the Guardians when the adult Loki telepathically tells her that the portal to Heven is open and that she can return home. As Thor battles Heven's guards, Angela appears having been guided to the doorway to Heven by Loki, and prepares to battle Thor.<ref>''Original Sin'' #5.2</ref> Angela defeats Thor, and is then told by the Queen of Angels to bring Thor to her. The now-female Loki has aligned with the Angels, telling Thor that "being on the winning side seems just perfect."<ref>''Original Sin'' #5.3</ref>

While Loki leads an Angel fleet to Asgard, under the false pretense to help them destroy it, Thor escapes captivity and engages Angela in combat once again.<ref>''Original Sin'' #5.4</ref> The fight between Thor and Angela is interrupted when Odin (who Loki freed from his self-exile) arrives and recognizes Angela as his daughter, revealing Angela's true lineage as the long thought dead Aldrif. A long time ago, the Angel tasked to dispose of Aldrif's body found out the baby was alive and raised her as one of the Angels under the name of Angela. In light of this revelation, the Queen of Angels grants Angela her life, pardoning her for her service to the Angels, but exiles her from Heven due to her lineage. After leaving Heven, Odin tells Thor, Loki, and Angela that he still loves his children. Angela then decides to leave in order to explore the other realms.<ref>''Original Sin'' #5.5</ref>

Later, Angela and her lover Sera abduct the newborn daughter of Odin and Freyja. Unbeknownst to Odin, the baby is possessed by the spirit of [[Surtur (Marvel Comics)|Surtur]] and Odin orders Thor to hunt down the pair. Angela and Sera with help from the Guardians of the Galaxy, stay ahead of Thor and take the baby to Heven to be cleansed of Surtur's spirit. There, Angela throws the baby into the stalled engines of Heven. Surtur's fire is expelled from the baby and reignites the engines of Heven. For this action, Angela's debt to Heven is repaid and thus closes her last remaining connection to the realm.<ref>''Angela: Asgard's Assassin'' #1-6</ref>

After Angela returns the baby to Odin, she discovers that Sera is actually [[Malekith the Accursed]] and the real Sera, who was previously killed in battle, remains in [[Hel (location)|Hel]]. Angela travels to Hel and petitions [[Hela (comics)|Hela]] to restore her love to life. When Hela refuses, Angela launches a campaign of conquest with the help of Sera and Hela's handmaiden, Leah, completing several trials to become the new Queen of Hel. When she succeeds, she frees the souls of the dead Angels enslaved by Hel, and restores Sera to life, only to abdicate and return to Earth with Sera and Leah, having no need for power.<ref>''Angela: Queen of Hel'' #1-5</ref>

===Other versions===
Several alternate versions of Angela appear in Marvel's 2015 ''[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]'' event. In ''1602: Witchhunter Angela'', Angela appears as a hunter of witchbreed (mutants) in the [[Marvel 1602|1602 universe]]. In ''MODOK: Assassin'', an Angela appears as a member of the Thors, Battleworld's peacekeeping force, wielding a hammer called Demonslayer. A third appears as a resident of the domain Arcadia, home of the all women superhero team, A-Force.<ref>A-Force vol. 1 #5 (October 2015)</ref>

==Genealogy==
{{Thor family tree}}

==Abilities==
In her current Marvel incarnation, Angela is a born God and heir to Asgardian throne.<ref>Original Sin Vol 1 #5.1</ref> She has enormous amounts of super strength which enables her to fight opponents like Jane Foster (Thor),<ref>Angela: Queen of Hel Vol 1 #6</ref> super speed where she moves faster than lighting and super durability where she can withstand attacks from the likes of Gamora, Drax and Thor. She also has the ability to fly. Unlike the rest of Asgardian Gods, Angela is immortal and doesn't require Golden Apples to sustain her youth. She lived for eons without any substance.<ref>Original Sin Vol 1 #5.3</ref>

==Legal rights==
In 1993 McFarlane contracted [[Neil Gaiman]], along with three other recognized authors, [[Alan Moore]], [[Dave Sim]], and [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]], to write one issue of ''Spawn''. While doing so, Gaiman introduced the characters Angela, [[Cogliostro]], and [[Hellspawn (Spawn)|Medieval Spawn]]. All three characters were co-created and designed by series creator [[Todd McFarlane]]. The series continued to feature all of the characters after Gaiman's involvement ended. Some characters had tie-ins with McFarlane's toy company, and Cogliostro had a prominent role in the live-action movie in 1997. McFarlane had initially agreed that Gaiman retained creator rights to the characters, but later claimed that Gaiman's work had been work-for-hire and that McFarlane owned all of Gaiman's co-creations entirely, pointing to the legal indicia of ''Spawn'' #9 and the lack of legal contract stating otherwise. McFarlane had also refused to pay Gaiman for the volumes of Gaiman's work that McFarlane republished and kept in print. In 2002, Gaiman filed suit and won a sizable judgment against McFarlane and Image Comics for the rights due any creator. All three characters were then equally co-owned by both men. In 2012, McFarlane and Gaiman settled their dispute,<ref>{{cite web|last=Phegley|first=Kiel|title=GAIMAN & MCFARLANE SETTLE SUIT ON MEDIEVAL SPAWN, ANGELA|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=36707|publisher=Comic Book Resources|accessdate=10 April 2013}}</ref> and Gaiman was given full ownership of Angela.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ching|first=Albert|title=TODD MCFARLANE Reacts to the Marvel/ANGELA Situation|url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/todd-mcfarlane-angela-marvel.html|publisher=Newsarama|accessdate=10 April 2013}}</ref>

On March 21, 2013, [[Comic Book Resources]] announced that Angela would be introduced into the Marvel Comics Universe as a major character later in the year, to coincide with [[Neil Gaiman]]'s return to the company.<ref name="CBR" /> [[BleedingCool]] later confirmed that Marvel Comics had completely bought the rights to Angela from Gaiman.<ref>{{cite web|last=Johnson|first=Rich|title=Marvel Owns Angela – But No, Karen Gillan Won’t Be Playing Her In Guardians Of The Galaxy|url=http://www.bleedingcool.com/2013/06/19/marvel-owns-angela-but-no-karen-gillan-wont-be-playing-her-in-guardians-of-the-galaxy/|publisher=BleedingCool|accessdate=19 June 2013}}</ref>
