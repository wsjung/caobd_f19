'''Spider-Man (Peter Parker)''' is a fictional character, a [[superhero]] developed and created by [[Insomniac Games]] created originally for the  ''[[Spider-Man (2018 video game)|Spider-Man]]'' video game in 2018. He loosely based on [[Spider-Man|the original character]] created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Steve Ditko]]. The character was later established in [[Marvel Comics]] continuity as an [[Alternative versions of Spider-Man|alternate version]] of Spider-Man. The fictional character was created in contribution by various writers such as Jon Parquette, Benjamin Arfmann, Kelsey Beachum, [[Christos Gage]] and [[Dan Slott]] and is voiced by [[Yuri Lowenthal]]. His primary suit is called the advanced suit which is designed differently than his comic book counterpart. 

He is depicted as an more mature Peter Parker who battles a various amount of [[List of Spider-Man enemies|opponents]] while struggling to balance his superhero and personal lives. The character has commonly received a positive reception within the game and has merchandise based on the character.

==Development == 
===Creation===
Several characters from [[Marvel Comics]] were considered to have their own game developed by [[Insomniac Games]] but the team’s final choice was to adapt [[Spider-Man]] in [[Spider-Man (2018 video game)|his own video game]], saying they related to the dynamic between the heroic Spider-Man and his everyman alter ego Peter Parker. Creative director Brian Intihar said "I feel like he's the most relatable of the heroes. As much as I love [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]], it's harder to identify with a billionaire. As much as I love [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], it's hard to identify with a god. Peter makes mistakes, he has ups and downs in his career, his relationships, his family. I think we can all relate to that."<ref name="web">{{cite web  |last=Watts |first=Steve|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvels-spider-man-how-insomniac-spun-its-web/1100-6464062/ |title=Marvel's Spider-Man: How Insomniac Spun Its Web |date=December 21, 2018 |website=[[GameSpot]]|accessdate=January 17, 2019 | archiveurl=http://archive.is/n70qR |archivedate=January 17, 2019  |deadurl=no  |ref=harv}}</ref> Price said "He's so human, and he's so relatable. He's also the most popular Marvel character in the world, I think". Price also considered the logistical benefits, as ''Sunset Overdrive'' featured a dynamic traversal system that they could build upon for Spider-Man.<ref>{{cite web|last=Barnett|first=Brian|url=https://uk.ign.com/articles/2018/09/10/how-insomniacs-spider-man-came-to-be-ign-unfiltered |title=How Insomniac'S Spider-Man Came To Be - IGN Unfiltered | date=September 10, 2018 |website=[[IGN]]|accessdate=January 17, 2019 |archiveurl=http://archive.is/7IJoS |archivedate=January 17, 2019 |deadurl=no  |ref=harv}}</ref> ''Spider-Man'' became the first licensed property by Insomniac in 22 years.<ref name="license">{{cite web  |last=Mathew |first=Adam |url=https://www.redbull.com/au-en/insomniac-developer-interview-spider-man-ps4 |title=How deep is Insomniac's PS4 Spider-sensibility?  |date=November 1, 2017 |publisher=[[Red Bull]]|accessdate=January 16, 2019 |archiveurl=http://archive.is/WZt62 |archivedate=January 16, 2019 |deadurl=no  |ref=harv}}</ref>  

Intihar collaborated with a team of writers under lead writer Jon Paquette to create an original take on Spider-Man that still remained true to the original.<ref name="web"/> Alongside lead Paquette, the story was written by Ben Arfman and Kelsey Beachum. Comic book and screenwriter [[Christos Gage]] co-wrote the script, and comic book writer [[Dan Slott]] provided additional story contributions.<ref name="Changes">{{cite web  |last=Marnell |first=Blair |url=https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/spider-man-ps4-writers-explain-the-changes-to-spidey-mjs-job-doc-ock-and-more |title=Spider-Man PS4 Writers Explain the Changes to Spidey, MJ's Job, Doc Ock, and More |date=September 10, 2018 |publisher=[[Syfy]]|accessdate=October 3, 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180913002455/https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/spider-man-ps4-writers-explain-the-changes-to-spidey-mjs-job-doc-ock-and-more |archivedate=September 13, 2018  |deadurl=no  |ref=harv}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=WGA Awards: Full List of Nominations |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lists/2019-wga-nominations-tv-new-media-radio-news-more-noms-1165913/item/original-screenplay-1165915 |date=December 6, 2018 |website=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |accessdate=January 25, 2019 |archiveurl=http://archive.is/U0FFa |archivedate=January 25, 2019  |deadurl=no}}</ref> Insomniac researched different iterations of the character to understand what made a compelling Spider-Man story, after which Paquette said "okay let's forget all that stuff", aiming to not draw too much from any single version. One less the team took from the research was that whenever Spider-Man wins, Peter Parker loses, and vice versa. Intihar said that from conception, the game was designed to be as much Parker's story as Spider-Man's.<ref name="web"/> The team deliberately avoided retelling Spider-Man's origin, reasoning "everyone kind of knows Spider-Man was bitten by a spider."<ref name="Changes"/>

===Voice===
[[Yuri Lowenthal]] provides the voice of Spider-Man / Peter Parker, but there was some initial reluctant to cast him as he had previously voiced a characteristically-different lead character in ''Sunset Overdrive'' and it was thought that he was not capable of providing a drastically different performance.<ref name="voice">{{cite web |last=Ruppert |first=Liana |url=https://comicbook.com/gaming/2018/04/04/spider-man-ps4-peter-parker-yuri-lowenthal/ |title=Spider-Man PS4 Lead Voice Actor Almost Rejected by Insomniac |date=April 4, 2018 |website=comicbook.com |accessdate=January 22, 2019 |archiveurl=http://archive.is/hthLo |archivedate=January 22, 2019  |deadurl=no  |ref=harv}}</ref> Working with voice director Kris Zimmerman, Lowenthal tried to differentiate his voices for Peter in his civilian life where he is more gentle, and as Spider-Man, where he is more confident.<ref name="voice commentary">{{cite web  |last=Salazar-Moreno |first=Quibian |url=https://www.gamecrate.com/interview-yuri-lowenthal-being-voice-spider-man-and-his-new-show-orbital-redux/20918 |title=Interview: Yuri Lowenthal On Being The Voice Of Spider-Man And His New Show, Orbital Redux |date=September 28, 2018 |publisher=[[Newegg]] |website=GameCrate.com |accessdate=January 23, 2019 |archiveurl=http://archive.is/0oVK3 |archivedate=January 23, 2019  |deadurl=no  |ref=harv}}</ref> Paquette convinced the studio to cast him in the role due to his trust in Lowenthal's acting ability. Lowenthal worked with two stunt people throughout the game's development. He tried to differentiate between his voices for Peter Parker and Spider-Man but thought that they could not be totally different and as a result spent a large amount of time "finessing and massaging" his performance to achieve a balance.<ref name="voice 2">{{cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2018/04/04/exclusive-interview-with-the-man-playing-spider-man.aspx|title=Exclusive Interview With The Man Playing Spider-Man|date=April 4, 2018|last=Vader|first=Leo|work=[[Game Informer]]|accessdate=April 4, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180405043238/http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2018/04/04/exclusive-interview-with-the-man-playing-spider-man.aspx|archive-date=April 5, 2018|dead-url=no}}</ref>

===Advanced costume===
Insomniac wanted to modernize the design of Spider-Man's costume while paying homage to the original design by [[Steve Ditko]]. The new design features a large white spider symbol that stretches across the torso, gauntlet-like gloves and a sneaker-style design based on athletic-wear instead of knee-high boots. Chew said the design goal was to create what a "23-year-old, would-be superhero" would wear in 2018 New York City. The traditional red and blue color scheme is retained in the costume, but with the addition of white. Chew compared the outfit to [[Compression garment|compression wear]], and said each color represented different materials. Blue is the most flexible and is where Spider-Man requires the most flexibility, such as his limbs. The red material is flexible but thicker for protection from minor scuffs and scrapes,  and the white is compared to a [[Carbon fibers|carbon fiber]], offering the most protection, so it is positioned on his chest, hands and feet.<ref name="costume">{{cite web |last=Saveedra|first=John |title=Spider-Man PS4: New Spidey Costume Explained |url=https://www.denofgeek.com/us/games/spider-man/276206/spider-man-ps4-new-spidey-costume-explained |date=September 11, 2018 |website=DenofGeek! |publisher=[[Dennis Publishing]] |accessdate=January 16, 2019 |archiveurl=http://archive.is/ZpZLA |archivedate=January 16, 2019 |deadurl=no |ref=harv}}</ref>

===''Spider-Man: Hostile Takeover''===
An official prequel book titled ''Spider-Man: Hostile Takeover'' by David Liss by [[Titan Publishing Group]] was released on August 21, 2018, predating the game release date. It details Spider-Man's fight with the book's version of [[Blood Spider]] and depicts the rivalry between Parker and the [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin]] before the events of the game.<ref>{{Cite book|year=2018|author=David Liss|title=''Marvel's Spider-Man: Hostile Takeover''|publisher=Titan Books|page=}}</ref> 

Liss explained to [[Syfy]] that ground rules had to be established by [[Marvel Comics]] and [[Insomniac Games]] of what elements of the game Liss could reveal in the book. He stated anything that happened in the novel "had to make sense in terms of the game" on making his book. <ref>{{cite web |title=SYFY |url=https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/exclusive-author-david-liss-on-his-new-video-game-prequel-novel-spider-man-hostile-takeover |website=www.syfy.com |accessdate=31 January 2019}}</ref>

|quote  = Insomniac's take on the classic Stan Lee/Steve Ditko character evokes everything that’s good about the half-century-old youngster, slinging together a kinetic, high-energy update that’s as much a playground for adrenaline junkies as it is an intimate meditation on the growing pains of a newcomer to adulthood.

Giuseppe Nelva of Dualshockers.com praises the character’s portrayal in the game noting that while he’s an older and more confident Spider-Man, he feels that his character still portrayed as human and still is prone to being goofy like in his comic book counterpart. He also praises the depiction of Peter’s maturity in the video game. <ref>{{cite web |title=Marvel's Spider-Man Review -- Insomniac Games' Masterpiece Is Amazing |url=https://www.dualshockers.com/marvel-spider-man-ps4-review/ |website=DualShockers |accessdate=26 January 2019 |language=en |date=4 September 2018}}</ref>
