'''Spitfire''' ('''Lady Jacqueline Falsworth Crichton''') is a fictional [[superheroine]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character was created by [[Roy Thomas]] and [[Frank Robbins]]. Her character was first introduced in the ''[[Invaders (comics)|Invaders]]'' comic book series as an intended replacement for the [[Union Jack (comics)|Union Jack]] character, but the costume design did not fit the female torso so the character of Spitfire, named after the [[Supermarine Spitfire]] fighter plane, was created.<ref name="ISH01">{{cite web |title=Spitfire |first= |last= |coauthors= |url=http://www.internationalhero.co.uk/s/spitfire.htm |work=internationalhero.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-07-18 }}</ref>

Thomas and Robbins concluded the plot-line in ''Invaders'' #11 (December 1976); in the story a life saving transfusion from original [[Human Torch (android)|Human Torch]] Jim Hammond reacts with the vampire bite to give her super-speed, which she uses to take her recently invalided father's place on the team.

{{quote|In recent years she's realized that she has actually started to be able to use certain vampiric abilities, and that the fangs appear when she gets angry. But she feels no blood lust, and has no need to drink it, and it's all completely under her control.|Paul Cornell<ref name="VBV">[http://www.marvel.com/news/comicstories.3984.Very_British_Vampires "Very British Vampires: Paul Cornell talks vampires and vampire hunters within the Marvel U’s newest super team"] by Marc Strom. Posted 2008-06-17. marvel.com</ref>}}

Even Spitfire herself shows some reservations about using her vampiric powers, as seen in the aforementioned attack on the Super-Skrulls:

{{quote|This is not how I am. But sometimes, this is how I ''have'' to be.|<ref name="Captain Britain and MI: 13 1"/>}}

While she initially resisted, it seemed that he was eventually able to convince her to become one of his minions;<ref>''Captain Britain and MI13'' #13</ref> it was later revealed that Spitfire has been a double-agent the whole time, always helping Wisdom in gaining intelligence on Dracula's whereabouts.{{Issue|date=September 2009}}

As part of the ''[[Marvel NOW!]]'' event, Spitfire was seen assisting Captain Britain in running the Braddock Academy (the British answer to the [[Avengers Academy]]).<ref>''Avengers Arena'' #5</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Jacqueline received superhuman powers as a result of a mutagenic reaction to a vampiric bite by the original [[Baron Blood]], and a subsequent transfusion of artificial blood from the original [[Human Torch (android)|Human Torch]]. As Spitfire, she possesses the ability to run at lightning-fast speeds, with reflexes & reactions, coordination, agility, and endurance to match. When she runs, a trail of non-damaging fire appears behind her. She can create cyclones by running in circles, and can run up walls and across water. Her skin is also hardened to withstand the rigors of such speed, providing a type of body armor, and her costume is synthetic stretch fabric chemically treated for protection from friction and other hazards of superhuman speed.

In the years after World War II, as Spitfire aged she ceased the use of her superhuman speed. Due to a second transfusion of artificial blood from the original Human Torch, Spitfire today has the body of a teenage girl, although she is chronologically many decades older. Her hair was originally still white from age, but it began turning blonde again.

It is said by the mutant sorceress, Selene, that Spitfire seems to possess a mutant regenerative power triggered by her transfusion of synthetic blood. With intensive study of her metabolism, blood stream, and glandular system, Selene hoped to one day duplicate the process.<ref name="MCP89"/>

She has some vampire abilities including fangs that appear when she is angry. However, she feels no blood lust and has no need to drink it.  She has shown superhuman strength sufficient enough to break a sword made out of titanium and also displayed a healing factor as she was able to heal a broken back and ribs in a few panels.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

Spitfire is a trained airplane pilot and exceptional athlete and hand-to-hand combatant, utilizing her ability to move at superhuman speeds, due to training by the original [[Union Jack (comics)|Union Jack]] and [[Captain America]].
