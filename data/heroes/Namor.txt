'''Namor the Sub-Mariner''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|n|eɪ|m|ɔːr}}) ('''Namor McKenzie''') is a [[fictional character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Debuting in early 1939, the character was created by writer-artist [[Bill Everett]] for [[Funnies Inc.]], one of the first "packagers" in the early days of comic books that supplied comics on demand to publishers looking to enter the new [[mass media|medium]]. Initially created for the unreleased comic ''[[Motion Picture Funnies Weekly]]'', the Sub-Mariner [[first appearance|first appeared]] publicly in ''[[Marvel Mystery Comics|Marvel Comics]]'' #1 ([[cover-date]]d Oct. 1939) – the first comic book from [[Timely Comics]], the 1930s–1940s predecessor of the company [[Marvel Comics]]. During that period, known to historians and fans as the [[Golden Age of Comic Books]], the Sub-Mariner was one of Timely's top three characters, along with [[Captain America]] and the original [[Human Torch (android)|Human Torch]]. Everett said the character's name was inspired by [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]'s poem, "[[The Rime of the Ancient Mariner]]".<ref>{{cite book|last = Sanderson|first = Peter|authorlink = Peter Sanderson|title = Marvel Universe|publisher = [[Abrams Books|Harry N.

The [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] son of a human sea captain and a princess of the mythical undersea kingdom of [[Atlantis (Marvel Comics)|Atlantis]], Namor possesses the super-strength and aquatic abilities of the ''[[Homo mermanus]]'' race, as well as the mutant ability of flight, along with other superhuman powers. Through the years, he has been portrayed as an antihero alternately from a good-natured but short-fused superhero, or a hostile invader seeking vengeance for perceived wrongs that misguided surface-dwellers committed against his kingdom.

Namor the Sub-Mariner first appeared in April 1939 in the prototype for a planned giveaway comic titled ''[[Motion Picture Funnies Weekly]]'', produced by the comic book packager [[Funnies Inc.]]<ref>{{cite book|last= Sanderson|first= Peter|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura, ed.|chapter= 1939|title= Marvel Chronicle A Year by Year History|publisher= [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year= 2008|location= London, United Kingdom|page= 11|isbn= 978-0756641238|quote= Writer/artist Bill Everett originally conceived Namor the Sub-Mariner in 1939 for an eight-page title called ''Motion Picture Funnies Weekly''.

In his first appearances Namor was an enemy of the United States. Comics historian [[Les Daniels]] noted that "Namor was a freak in the service of chaos. Although the Sub-Mariner acted like a villain, his cause had some justice, and readers reveled in his assaults on civilization. His enthusiastic fans weren't offended by the carnage he created as he wrecked everything from ships to skyscrapers."<ref>{{cite book|last = Daniels|first = Les|authorlink = Les Daniels|title = Marvel: Five Fabulous Decades of the World's Greatest Comics|publisher = [[Abrams Books|Harry N.

Namor starred in the Golden Age comic book ''Sub-Mariner Comics'', published quarterly, then thrice-yearly, and finally bimonthly, from issues #1–32 (Fall 1941 – June 1949).<ref>[http://www.comics.org/series/239/ ''Sub-Mariner Comics''] at the [[Grand Comics Database]]</ref> A backup feature each issue starred the detective-superhero the [[Angel (Thomas Halloway)|Angel]]. Along with many other Timely characters, Namor disappeared a few years after the end of World War II and the decline in popularity of superhero comics.<ref>Sanderson "1940s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 41: This final issue [#32 (June 1949)] of the 1940s ''Sub-Mariner Comics'' series presented [Bill] Everett's new retelling of [the character's origin].</ref> He briefly fought crime as a member of the post-war superhero team the [[All-Winners Squad]], and, through a 1970s [[retroactive continuity|retcon]], was given a history of having fought with the Allies during World War II in the superhero team the [[Invaders (comics)|Invaders]]. Both these super-groups were built around the core of Namor, Captain America, and the original Human Torch.

The Sub-Mariner experienced a brief revival in the mid-1950s at [[Atlas Comics (1950s)|Atlas Comics]], the 1950s iteration of Marvel. Along with Captain America and the original Human Torch, he was revived in ''Young Men'' #24. Soon afterward, ''Sub-Mariner Comics'' was revived with issues #33–42 (April 1954 – Oct. 1955).<ref>[http://www.comics.org/series/1052/ ''Sub-Mariner Comics'' (revival)] at the Grand Comics Database</ref><ref>[[Tom Brevoort|Brevoort, Tom]] "1950s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 58: "After his popularity in ''Young Men'', the Sub-Mariner was given back his own title."</ref> During this time, Namora had her own spin-off series.<!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:Sub-Mariner33.jpg|185px|thumb|right|''Sub-Mariner'' #33 (April 1954): This first issue of the brief 1950s revival featured rare cover art by character creator [[Bill Everett]].]] --><!--signed; also confirmed per GCD, both pencils & inks-->

===Silver Age and after===
Namor returned in ''[[Fantastic Four (comic book)|Fantastic Four]]'' #4 (May 1962), where a member of the titular superhero team, Johnny Storm, the new [[Human Torch]], discovers him living as an [[amnesia]]c [[homelessness|homeless]] man in the [[Bowery]] section of [[Manhattan]].<ref>[[Tom DeFalco|DeFalco, Tom]] "1960s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 86: "Stan Lee and Jack Kirbuy reintroduced one of Marvel's most popular Golden Age heroes – Namor, the Sub-Mariner."</ref><ref name="mnyc">{{Cite book| last = Sanderson|first = Peter|title = The Marvel Comics Guide to New York City|publisher = [[Pocket Books]]|year = 2007|location= New York, New York|pages = 17–18|isbn = 1-4165-3141-6}}</ref> Storm helps him recover his memory, and Namor immediately returns to his undersea kingdom – identified, for the first time in the Marvel canon, as [[Atlantis (Marvel Comics)|Atlantis]]. Finding it destroyed from [[nuclear weapons testing|nuclear testing]], Namor assumes his people are scattered and that he will never find them. He again becomes an [[antihero]] during this period, as two elements – a thirst for vengeance and a quest for identity – would dominate the Sub-Mariner stories of the 1960s. He was both a villain and a hero – striking against the human race who destroyed his home, but showing a great deal of ''[[noblesse oblige]]'' to individuals.<ref>{{cite book|first=Mike|last=Benton|title=Superhero Comics of the Silver Age: The Illustrated History |publisher=[[L.G.

Initially, Namor variously finds himself allied with the [[supervillain]]s [[Doctor Doom]] and [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]], but his royal nobility and stubborn independent streak make these alliances-of-convenience short-lived. Namor's revival was a hit with readers, but Marvel could not give him his own title due to publication and distribution restrictions that would not be lifted until 1968.<ref name="Back27"/> Instead, Namor was given numerous guest-appearances – including in ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]'' #7 (April 1965), a rare superhero story drawn by comics great [[Wally Wood]] – and a starring feature in the split-title comic ''[[Tales to Astonish]]'' (beginning issue #70, Aug. 1965).<ref>DeFalco "1960s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 109: "Prince Namor replaced Giant-Man as the lead feature in ''Tales to Astonish'' #70. The Sub-Mariner series was written by Stan Lee and drawn by Gene Colan, who was using the pen name Adam Austin at the time."</ref> By now, during a period fans and historians call the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]], he is more authoritative, arrogant and solemn than the impetuous youthful character of the 1940s and mid-1950s, speaking in neo-[[William Shakespeare|Shakespearean]] dialogue rather than the more [[colloquialism|colloquial]] speech of his youth, often shouting his battle cry, "Imperius Rex!".

He was spun off into his own title, the 1968–74 series ''Sub-Mariner''.<ref name=gcd1968>[http://www.comics.org/series/1874/ ''Sub-Mariner''] at the Grand Comics Database</ref> The super-villain [[Tiger Shark (Marvel Comics)|Tiger Shark]] was introduced in issue #5 by writer [[Roy Thomas]] and artist [[John Buscema]]<ref>DeFalco "1960s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 131: "Created by writer Roy Thomas and artist John Buscema, Tiger Shark was super-strong and had razor-sharp teeth."</ref> and the super-hero [[Stingray (comics)|Stingray]] in issue #19 by Thomas and Bill Everett.<ref>DeFalco "1960s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 139</ref> Some of the later issues of this ''Sub-Mariner'' series are notable for having been written and drawn by the character's creator, Bill Everett, shortly before his death; as well, they reintroduced a now-older Namora, and introduced her daughter, [[Namorita|Namorita Prentiss]]. By now more of a reluctant superhero "the Sub-Mariner was perfect for the Marvel Age of angst-ridden protagonists. Noble yet misunderstood, powerful yet thwarted ... [he was] portrayed as a regal monarch – a king without a country."<ref>Benton, p. 100</ref> The final issue,  #72 (Sept. 1974), was written by [[Steve Skeates]] and featured an unofficial [[intercompany crossover]] with the last issue of [[DC Comics]]' ''[[Aquaman]]'' series.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=40191|title= CCI: That '70s (Creators) Panel|first= Michael|last= May|date= August 1, 2012|publisher= [[Comic Book Resources]]|archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/6ExNU3vI6?url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=40191|archivedate= March 8, 2013|deadurl= no|accessdate= March 7, 2013|quote= [Mark] Evanier asked what work from that period the writer is most proud of. Skeates replied that he was pleased with the experimentation he'd started doing on the last four issues of ''Aquaman'' and talked a little about the unofficial Aquaman/Sub-Mariner crossover he'd been allowed to write for Marvel. Since ''Aquaman'' had been cancelled abruptly on a cliffhanger, Roy Thomas let Skeates wrap up the story in a fill-in issue of ''Sub-Mariner.''|df= mdy-all}}</ref> A five- to six-page backup feature, "Tales of Atlantis", chronicling the undersea kingdom from its ancient origins, appeared in issues #62–66 (June–Oct. 1973), written by Gerber, with penciling by [[Howard Chaykin]] and later [[Jim Mooney]].<ref name=gcd1968 /> After the cancellation of ''Sub-Mariner'', Namor co-starred with Doctor Doom in the ''[[Super-Villain Team-Up]]'' series.<ref>Sanderson "1970s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 168: "Namor, the Sub-Mariner sought a new alliance with Doctor Doom in this giant-size comic."</ref> The series suffered from mediocre sales due to its lack of a stable creative team,<ref name="Back27"/> and following issue #13 Namor was dropped from the co-star spot.

Following a four-issue [[miniseries]] a decade later, ''Prince Namor, the Sub-Mariner'' (Sept.-Dec. 1984), by scripter/co-plotter [[J. M. DeMatteis]], penciler/co-plotter [[Bob Budiansky]], and inker Danny Bulanadi,<ref name="back91">{{cite journal|last=Lantz|first=James Heath |title=Prince Namor the Sub-Mariner: Scion of the Deep or Royal Pain?|journal=[[Back Issue!]]|issue=91|pages=50–62 |publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|date=September 2016|location=Raleigh, North Carolina}}</ref> the 12-issue [[maxiseries]] ''The Saga of the Sub-Mariner'' (Nov. 1988 – Oct. 1989) provided a retrospective of Namor's past adventures while tying up loose plot threads and resolving contradictions that had accumulated over the character's decades of published history.<ref name="Back27"/> Namor again received an ongoing series in 1990. ''Namor, the Sub-Mariner'', which ran 62 issues (April 1990 – May 1995), was initially written and penciled by [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] who took over the inking as well from issues #4–21.<ref>Manning, Matthew K. "1990s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 248: "Comics superstar John Byrne revamped the classic Marvel character Namor in this new series that he both wrote and drew."</ref> Unlike all of Namor's previous series, the cover logo emphasized the character's name rather than the "Sub-Mariner" epithet.<ref name="back91"/> From #26–38, the series' penciler and eventual penciler-inker was then-newcomer [[Jae Lee]], with [[Bob Harras]] scripting from #33–40. After three fill-in issues, the remainder of the series was written by [[Glenn Herdling]] and pencilled by [[Geof Isherwood]]. This series followed Namor as CEO of Oracle, Inc., a corporation devoted to reducing pollution, particularly in the oceans, and provided the stage for the return of the 1970s [[martial artist]] superhero [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]], who had been presumed dead. Whereas J. M. DeMatteis saw his series as an opportunity to explore Namor much more deeply than he had been able to in the team book ''[[Defenders (comics)|The Defenders]]'', John Byrne felt that the character did not work well outside of a group context and accordingly gave ''Namor, the Sub-Mariner'' a massive supporting cast.<ref name="back91"/>

The 12-issue miniseries ''Namor'' (June 2003 – May 2004), credited to co-writers [[Bill Jemas]] (then Marvel's president) and [[Andi Watson]], and penciled initially by [[Salvador Larroca]] and later by [[Pat Olliffe]] and others, explored Namor's youth, charting his teenage romance with a young American girl in the early 20th century. A six-issue miniseries, ''Sub-Mariner'' vol. 2 (Aug. 2007 – Jan. 2008), by co-writers Matt Cherniss and Peter Johnson and, primarily, artist Phil Briones, introduced Namor's heretofore undisclosed son, Kamar.

Namor was featured in his own ongoing series, ''Namor: The First Mutant'', in 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.newsarama.com/comics/Namor-Ongoing-Marvel-100513.html|title= Marvel Announces ''Namor'' Ongoing Series|first= |last= |date= May 13, 2010|publisher= [[Newsarama]]|archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/6ExKpYXnV?url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/Namor-Ongoing-Marvel-100513.html|archivedate= March 8, 2013|deadurl= no|accessdate= March 7, 2013|df= mdy-all}}</ref> The series was cancelled after less than a year into its publication.<ref name="Tramountanas">{{cite web|url= http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=31834|title= X-Position: Stuart Moore Swims with ''Namor''|first= George A.|last= Tramountanas|date= April 12, 2011|publisher= Comic Book Resources|archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/6ExLAdJ1p?url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=31834|archivedate= March 8, 2013|deadurl= no|accessdate= March 7, 2013|df= mdy-all}}</ref>

Namor has also served alongside, or even as a member of, superhero teams – most notably the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]],<ref>Sanderson "1970s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 151: "[Roy] Thomas and artist Ross Andru reunited [Doctor] Strange, the Hulk, and Namor as a brand new Marvel superhero team – the Defenders."</ref> which included [[Doctor Strange]], the Hulk, and the [[Silver Surfer]]. Other groups he was associated with included the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]; and both the World War II and modern-day versions of the Invaders.

Marvel revived ''The Defenders'', with Namor on the team, in December 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://marvel.com/news/story/16312/sdcc_2011_defenders|title= SDCC 2011: Defenders|first= Jim|last= Beard|date= July 29, 2011|publisher= Marvel Comics|archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/6ExLuseJo?url=http://marvel.com/news/story/16312/sdcc_2011_defenders|archivedate= March 8, 2013|deadurl= no|accessdate= March 7, 2013|quote= The events of ''Fear Itself'' will lead to a new formation of the legendary Marvel team, spotlighting such heroes as Doctor Strange, Namor the Sub-Mariner, The Silver Surfer, Iron Fist, Red She-Hulk and a roundtable of other Marvel favorites.|df= mdy-all}}</ref> The series was cancelled after 12 issues.

He became one of the main characters, along with the other Illuminati members, in the third volume of ''[[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]]'' beginning in 2013.

==Fictional character biography==
As related in ''[[Marvel Mystery Comics|Marvel Comics]]'' #1 ([[cover-date]]d Oct. 1939) and subsequent, expanded retellings of his [[origin story]], Namor was born in the capital city of the initially unnamed Atlantean empire, then located off the [[Antarctic]] coast. His mother was Emperor Thakorr's daughter, Fen, and his father an American sea captain, Leonard McKenzie, of the icebreaker ''Oracle''; they had fallen in love and married aboard ship while she was, unbeknownst to him, spying on the human intruders. When Fen did not return, Atlantean warriors attacked the ''Oracle'', evidently killing McKenzie, and returned Fen to her kingdom. The pink-skinned [[mutant (comics)|mutant]] Namor was subsequently born among the blue-skinned Atlanteans. He became the Prince of Atlantis, and a warrior for his people against the "surface-dwellers". He became friends with New York City police woman Betty Dean in ''[[Marvel Mystery Comics]]'' #3 (Jan. 1940), and when the U.S. entered World War II, he began fighting the [[Axis powers]]. In [[flashback (narrative)|flashback]] stories beginning in the 1970s, he was [[retconned]] as a member of the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] superhero team the [[Invaders (comics)|Invaders]], consisting originally of himself, [[Captain America]], [[Bucky Barnes|Bucky]], the [[Human Torch (android)|original Human Torch]], and [[Toro (comics)|Toro]].

Namor is injured after the war, and in ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' #4 is shown living in the flophouse [[Bowery]] district of [[Manhattan]] as an [[amnesia]]c derelict. Regaining his memory in this story, he becomes enraged upon learning that the original site of Atlantis was destroyed by nuclear testing, its inhabitants evacuated. Namor vows revenge on humanity, but after several attacks thwarted by superheroes, including in ''Fantastic Four'' #6, 9, and 14 (Sept. and Dec. 1962, May 1963), ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #107 (April 1963), he finds his people and launches an unsuccessful invasion of New York City in ''Fantastic Four Annual'' #1 (1963).<ref name=gcd-character>[http://www.comics.org/character/name/sub-mariner/sort/chrono/ Sub-Mariner (character)] at the [[Grand Comics Database]]</ref>

Namor Mackenzie returns to Atlantis to marry his royal cousin, [[Lady Dorma]]. In ''Sub-Mariner'' #37 (May 1971), the evil princess [[Llyra]] of [[Lemuria (continent)|Lemuria]], another undersea culture, kidnaps and replaces Dorma at the wedding, hoping to usurp Namor's kingdom. Though Namor's marriage to Dorma is still official, she dies as a result of Llyra's machinations.<ref>Sanderson "1970s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 149: "Llyra murdered the water-breathing Dorma by forcing her to suffocate in open air."</ref> In issues #45–46 (Nov.-Dec. 1971) Namor finally meets his father, long thought dead, only to lose him when McKenzie gives his life in battle against the [[supervillain]] [[Tiger Shark (Marvel Comics)|Tiger Shark]].

In the [[one-shot (comics)|one-shot]] ''New Avengers: Illuminati'' (May 2006), Namor is revealed to have been a member for several years of the clandestine policy group the [[Illuminati (comics)|Illuminati]], with [[Mister Fantastic]], [[Iron Man]], [[Doctor Strange]], [[Professor X]], and [[Black Bolt]]. In the series ''Sub-Mariner'' vol. 2, #1–6 (Aug. 2007 – Jan. 2008), he discovers his long-lost son Kamar, who attempts to usurp the throne of Atlantis but is killed by the supervillain [[Nitro (comics)|Nitro]].

In 2011, Namor joined the mutant superhero team the [[X-Men]].<ref name="Tramountanas" /><ref>{{cite comic| writer= Aaron, Jason; Bendis, Brian Michael; Brubaker, Ed; Hickman, Jonathan; Fraction, Matt|penciller= Romita Jr., John|inker= Hanna, Scott|story= Round 1|title= Avengers vs. X-Men|issue= 1|date= June 2012}}</ref> Namor helped with the [[Curse of the Mutants]],<ref>''Namor: the First Mutant'' #1–4</ref> and [[Avengers vs. X-Men]] events,<ref>''Avengers vs X-Men'' #1–12</ref> before joining the [[The New Avengers (comics)#Volume 3 (2013–2015)|Illuminati]],<ref>''New Avengers: Illuminati'' one-shot (May 2006)</ref> and [[All-New Invaders]].<ref>''All-New Invaders'' #1</ref> That same year, during the "[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]" storyline, Namor enlists the aid of [[She-Hulk (Lyra)|Lyra]], [[Loa (comics)|Loa]], [[Silver Surfer]], and [[Doctor Strange]] after he is ousted from his kingdom by [[Attuma]], who was transformed into Nerkodd: Breaker of Oceans.

When the X-Men relocated to [[Utopia (comics)|Utopia]] off the coast of San Francisco, Namor assists them due to his sympathy with their status as outsiders. As a result, he sides with the X-Men during the subsequent [[Avengers vs. X-Men|war with the Avengers]] over the coming of the [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix Force]] to Earth, eventually becoming one of the 'Phoenix Five' when the Phoenix Force is fractured between himself, Cyclops, [[Emma Frost]], [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] and [[Magik (comics)|Magik]].<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Jason Aaron|Aaron, Jason]]; [[Brian Michael Bendis|Bendis, Brian Michael]]; [[Ed Brubaker|Brubaker, Ed]]; [[Jonathan Hickman|Hickman, Jonathan]]; [[Matt Fraction|Fraction, Matt]]|penciller= [[John Romita Jr.|Romita Jr., John]]|inker= [[Scott Hanna|Hanna, Scott]]|story= Round 5|title= [[Avengers vs. X-Men]]|issue= 5|date= August 2012}}</ref> He is eventually defeated by a mass attack from the Avengers when he attacks [[Wakanda]], becoming the first of the Phoenix Five to fall.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Aaron, Jason; Bendis, Brian Michael; Brubaker, Ed; Hickman, Jonathan; [[Matt Fraction|Fraction, Matt]]|penciller= [[Adam Kubert|Kubert, Adam]]|inker= [[John Dell|Dell, John]]|story= Round 8|title= Avengers vs. X-Men|issue= 8|date= September 2012}}</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Because of his unusual genetic heritage, Namor is unique among both ordinary humans and Atlanteans; he is sometimes referred to as "Marvel's first mutant" because, while the majority of his observed superhuman powers come from the fact that he is a hybrid of human and Atlantean DNA, his ability to fly can't be explained by either side (Atlanteans are an offshoot of "baseline" humanity); though, in terms of in-continuity chronology, there were many mutants in existence before Namor. Namor possesses a fully amphibious physiology suited for extreme undersea pressures, superhuman strength, speed, agility, durability, flight, and longevity. Namor has the ability to survive underwater for indefinite periods, and specially developed vision which gives him the ability to see clearly in the murky depths of the ocean.

Bill Everett, in his first Sub-Mariner story, described the character as "an ultra-man of the deep [who] lives on land and in the sea, flies in the air, [and] has the strength of a thousand [surface] men". No other powers were mentioned. When the series was revived in 1954<!--issue #33 cover-dated April 1954-->, Namor lost his ankle wings and with them the power of flight; they, and his full strength, were restored in ''Sub-Mariner Comics'' #38 (Feb. 1955), in which Everett additionally wrote a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] story, "Wings on His Feet", detailing their appearance on Namor at age 14. This story was twice reprinted during the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]], in ''[[Marvel Super-Heroes (comics)|Marvel Super-Heroes]]'' #17 (Nov. 1968), and in the book ''Comix'' by [[Les Daniels]].

Namor has the ability to swim at superhuman speeds, even by Atlantean standards.

Namor has greater longevity than a normal human being. He is well over 90 years old as he was born in 1920 in the Marvel timeline, but has the appearance of a male in his prime. His identity as a pre–World War II superhero is well-established, making him less subject to the [[floating timeline|sliding timescale]] of the Marvel universe.

During Namor's original fight with the Human Torch in ''Marvel Mystery Comics'' #8 (June 1940, and the first fight between superheroes to appear in any media), Namor was able to forcibly expel water from his body to extinguish fires, although it proved useless against the Torch.<ref>{{cite comic|writer= [[Bill Everett|Everett, Bill]]|penciller= Everett, Bill|inker= Everett, Bill|story= The Human Torch and the Sub-Mariner Meet|title= [[Marvel Mystery Comics]]|issue= 8|date= June 1940}}<br>{{cite comic|writer= [[Carl Burgos|Burgos, Carl]]|penciller= Burgos, Carl|inker= Burgos, Carl|story= The Search For Sub-Mariner|title= Marvel Mystery Comics|issue= 8 |date= June 1940}}</ref>

After he was revived yet again in the 1960s by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, Namor demonstrated powers of various sealife that had not been shown in earlier stories.  An editorial note in ''[[Marvel Tales]]'' #9 (July 1967), stated explicitly that "nautical Namor has since lost his power to imitate the characteristics of fish..." According to one of Sub-Mariner's scripters, Roy Thomas: "As for Namor's electrical and other sea-creaturely powers. They were used in one or two stories in ''F.F.'' and the Human Torch series in ''Strange Tales'', then dropped – as one of Stan [Lee] and Jack [Kirby]s early (and quite forgivable) mistakes. The explanation, given in a reprint of a Torch/Namor bout a few years later, was that he had these powers only for a short time and then lost them."<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Thomas, Roy|story= Okay, Axis, Here We Come! (text article)|title= The Invaders|issue= 35|date= December 1978}}</ref>

In all his incarnations, Namor possesses superhuman strength and, with the possible exceptions of [[Orka (comics)|Orka]] and [[Tyrak]] at their full sizes, is the strongest Atlantean ever known. The exact level of his strength is dependent upon his physical contact with water, in which he needn't be submerged. It has been shown as sufficient to effortlessly toss a water-filled ocean-liner, despite the underwater [[viscosity]].<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Christian Cooper|Cooper, Chris]]|penciller= [[Doug Wheatley|Wheatley, Doug]]|inker= Wheatley, Doug|story= Lifesblood|title= Hulk / Sub-Mariner '98 |issue= 1|date= 1998}}</ref> His strength diminishes slowly the longer he is out of contact with water, though an extended period on land does not result in his death, as it would for a typical Atlantean, and his power is retained in full as long as he keeps himself wet. Namor possesses superhuman stamina and resistance to injury due to his hybrid nature. Namor's strength level is such that he has held his own in hand-to-hand combat with beings as powerful as the [[Hulk]] in the past.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Stan Lee|Lee, Stan]]|penciller= [[Herb Trimpe|Trimpe, Herb]]|inker= Trimpe, Herb|story= A Clash of Titans|title= The Incredible Hulk|volume= 2|issue= 118|date= August 1969}}</ref>

Some stories have mentioned that Namor has gills for breathing underwater, e.g., in ''Namor, the Sub-Mariner'' #5, Namor thinks "this New York river water burns my gills and scalds my lungs".<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Byrne, John|penciller= Byrne, John|inker= Byrne, John|story= All the Rivers Burning!|title= Namor, the Sub-Mariner|issue= 5|date= August 1990}}</ref> and artists such as [[Salvador Larroca]] have drawn him with gill slits on either side of his neck.<ref>[http://www.comics.org/series/10988/ ''Namor''] at the Grand Comics Database</ref> In ''The Sub-Mariner'' #18–22 (1969–70), beings from outer space surgically closed Namor's gills for a time, leaving him with the ability to breathe air but unable to breathe underwater. Other sources have stated that his lungs contain oxygen diffusing membranes that allow him to breathe underwater.

Namor possesses a telepathic rapport with all forms of marine life. He is able to mentally communicate with most forms of marine life and can mentally persuade them to do his bidding. Namor can mentally communicate with other Atlanteans and give mental-telepathic orders to all his men.<ref>{{cite comic|writer= Everett, Bill|penciller= Everett, Bill|inker= Everett, Bill|story= The Serum Must Get Through!|title= [[Human Torch (android)|Human Torch]]|issue= 4|date= Spring 1941}}</ref>

Due to a unique aspect of his hybrid nature, not shared by [[Namorita]], it was theorized that Namor is vulnerable to oxygen imbalances in his blood that trigger manic-depressive mood swings; he can prevent imbalances by regular immersion in water.

Namor gives off a sense of charisma which most women tend to find captivating.  Many of the ladies that have entered his life made clear their attraction to his masculine, slightly alien personality in ways both subtle and blatant.  He reacts to such advances with gratitude tinged with a slight distance born of monarchical etiquette.

Namor is a natural leader, trained by the royal family of Atlantis as befitting an heir to the throne.  He has historically led troops into battle with expert success.  His typical interpersonal behavior with both subject and friend borders on the aloof; this is more a sense of regal ''noblesse oblige'' rather than snobbishness.

Namor was given possession of the [[Infinity Gems|Time Gem]].<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Bendis, Brian Michael; Reed, Brian|penciller= [[Jim Cheung|Cheung, Jim]]|inker= [[Mark Morales (comics)|Morales, Mark]]|story= This...is an Infinity Gem|title= New Avengers: Illuminati|issue= 2|date= March 2007}}</ref> This gem allows the user total control over the past, present, and future. It allows time travel, can age and de-age beings, and can be used as a weapon by trapping enemies or entire worlds in unending loops of time. After the [[Hood (comics)|Hood]] attempted to steal the Gems, Namor briefly helped Thor recover the Gem from the bottom of the ocean to prevent the Hood acquiring it, before being entrusted with the Power Gem as the Gems were divided amongst the new Illuminati – Steve Rogers replacing Black Bolt – once again.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Bendis, Brian Michael|penciller= Romita Jr., John|inker= [[Klaus Janson|Janson, Klaus]]|story= My name is Thanos|title= The Avengers|volume= 4|issue= 12|date= June 2011}}</ref>

Namor was educated by the royal tutors of the Atlantean court, and speaks English, Atlantean, and Lemurian. He is a highly skilled business executive.

===Formerly depicted abilities===
In ''The Fantastic Four'' #9 (Dec. 1962), Namor states, "I have the powers of all the creatures who live beneath the sea! I can charge the very air with electricity – using the power of the electric eel!"  In the same issue, "the radar sense of the cave fish from the lowest depths of the sea" enables him to sense the presence of Sue Storm when she is invisible. He uses "the power to surround himself with electricity in the manner of an electric eel" again in ''[[Strange Tales]]''  #107 (April 1963), and #125 (Oct. 1964); in the former he manifests the power to inflate his body like a puffer fish. These extra powers were ignored, when Marvel gave Namor his own feature beginning in ''[[Tales to Astonish]]'' #70 (Aug. 1965).

Another ability unknown in the Golden Age and rarely displayed is his empathic rapport with many forms of marine life. He had a limited empathic rapport with Namorita, but only as a result of being given one of her "magic earrings" (which has long since disappeared).

An editorial note in ''[[Marvel Tales]]'' #9 (July 1967), which reprinted the story from ''Strange Tales'' #107, stated explicitly that "nautical Namor has since lost his power to imitate the characteristics of fish..."  His electrical abilities were seen out of comic continuity in 1991's ''[[Spider-Man: The Video Game]]''. Furthermore, Namor employed these "lost" powers semi-regularly in his 1990s series, under John Byrne's pen.

=="Marvel's first mutant"==
Marvel has repeatedly identified Namor as "Marvel's first mutant", which is true with regard to the order in which the character appeared in print.  He is not the oldest mutant within the fictional [[Marvel Universe]] timeline. A number of mutants predate him, including [[Selene (comics)|Selene]] (active since at least 10,000 BC), [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] (born in the 30th century BC), [[Exodus (comics)|Exodus]] (born in the 12th century AD), [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] (late 19th century AD), [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]] and [[Destiny (Irene Adler)|Destiny]] (dates of birth unknown, but known to have been active at the "Dawn of the 20th century"), the demonic mutant [[Azazel (Marvel Comics)|Azazel]], and a group of mutants known as the [[Externals]].

In ''X-Men'' #6<!-- W:MOS: vol. 1 not labeled, only subsequent volumes --> (July 1964), [[X-Men]] leader Professor Xavier and antagonist Magneto each suspect Namor is a mutant and make efforts to recruit him. Later writers in the 1960s and 1970s described him as a hybrid, not a mutant, in order to distinguish him from the mutant X-Men.<ref>As explained in the letters page of ''Sub-Mariner'' #31 (November 1970)</ref> When the series was revived in 1990, the series title logo carried the subtitle "Marvel's first and mightiest mutant!".

Namor is actually a hybrid of Atlantean and human physiology, although he has principal characteristics that neither Atlanteans (''Homo mermanus'') nor humans (''Homo sapiens'') possess. These include his ability to fly, and possibly his durability and strength (which is several times that of an Atlantean).

In the first issue of the five part ''Illuminati'' miniseries, after being experimented on by the Skrulls, it was confirmed that Namor is not only an Atlantean/human hybrid but also a mutant.

==Enemies==
* [[Attuma]] – Leader of the Atlantean barbarians, Attuma would threaten Atlantis repeatedly; conquering it on several occasions, and became Namor's nemesis.
* [[Byrrah]] – Childhood friend and rival to Namor, Byrrah was Atlantean royalty that lost the throne to Namor and observed him as unfit for the position. For many years, he would challenge Namor's rule and ally with his enemies to usurp him. Eventually, he appears to have made peace with Namor and stands by his side as a brother.

* [[Orka (comics)|Orka]] – An underling of Krang empowered by Doctor Dorcas to be massively strong and grow stronger in the presence of [[orca]]. He would return repeatedly as a minion for Namor's enemies.
* [[Piranha (comics)|Piranha]] – Created by Doctor Dorcas, the Piranha is an ever-evolving enemy of Namor to return again and again.
* [[Puppet Master (Marvel Comics)|Puppet Master]] – Using Namor as a pawn on several occasions, such as against the [[Fantastic Four]] and in obtaining funds, the Puppet Master would garner the ire of the sea king. On one occasion, when Namor considered befriending the [[Hulk]], Puppet Master took the green behemoth over and forced him to battle Namor.
* [[Tiger Shark (Marvel Comics)|Tiger Shark]] – An Olympic swimmer transformed by Doctor Dorcas into a [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] of Namor's DNA and a [[tiger shark]]. He battles Namor repeatedly over the years, at one time an ally to the sea king, though today he has again chosen to be his enemy.

* [[U-Man]] – Meranno was a childhood rival to Namor that joined the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]] and took the name U-Man. Leading the Nazis to Atlantis, their attack left its emperor in a coma with Namor succeeding him. During [[World War II]], he would be Namor's frequent sparring partner.
* [[Krang (Marvel Comics)|Warlord Krang]] – One time military leader of Atlantis' forces, Krang tried to usurp Namor's power and became an enemy to the kingdom. He would return repeatedly to challenge Namor.

==Other versions==

===Marvel Noir===
In the ''[[Marvel Noir]]'' reality, Namor is a captain of a ship named "Dorma".<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Scott Snyder|Snyder, Scott]]|penciller= [[Manuel Garcia (comics)|Garcia, Manuel]]|inker= [[Lorenzo Ruggiero|Ruggiero, Lorenzo]]|title= [[Marvel Noir|Iron Man Noir]]|issue= 1|date= June 2010}}</ref> '''Captain Namor''' is a widely infamous pirate of the seven seas and an associate of [[Tony Stark]], who pays him for the numerous voyages on his adventures. Namor considers himself as a man of the sea and doesn't share any allegiances to any countries or nations. As part of his tradition as a pirate, Namor marks himself and his crew by slicing their ears to look like shark's fins. He is the captain of the Dorma, an advanced submarine while taking the guise of a fishing trawler.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Snyder, Scott|penciller= Garcia, Manuel|inker= Ruggiero, Lorenzo|title= Iron Man Noir|issue= 2|date= July 2010}}</ref>

In May 1939, Stark hired Namor to find the location of [[Atlantis (Marvel Comics)|Atlantis]]. He traveled with Stark, [[War Machine|James Rhodes]], and [[Pepper Potts]] on the submersible, the "Happy Hogan", in locating Atlantis and finding the valuable Orichalcum. Upon returning to the surface, Namor and his friends were immediately captured by the [[Nazis]] led by [[Baron Zemo]] and [[Baron Strucker|Von Strucker]], and the Orichalcum stolen by them. Namor and his allies were then left to die on his trawler by torpedo; Namor took action in having everyone quickly board the Dorma and escape before the torpedo destroyed the trawler. Namor later rescued Stark following the destruction of Von Strucker's airship fleet, as (in Namor's words) Stark owes him a boat for the destruction of his.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Snyder, Scott|penciller= Garcia, Manuel|inker= Ruggiero, Lorenzo|title= Iron Man Noir|issue= 4|date= September 2010}}</ref>

===MC2===
Namor is still active in the [[Marvel Comics 2|MC2]] future timeline, and still uniting occasionally for battle alongside the [[Alternative versions of the Hulk#MC-2|Hulk]] and Doctor Strange as "Defenders". His appearance, while slightly older looking, is unchanged save for growing a goatee. In ''[[Fantastic Five]]'' vol. 2 #1 it was revealed that he had held [[Alternative versions of Doctor Doom#MC2|Doctor Doom]] captive for over ten years, after the mad monarch destroyed Atlantis. Doom subsequently escaped, and in #4, Namor is seen being tortured by him. He is freed after [[Alternative versions of Mister Fantastic#MC2|Reed Richards]] sacrifices himself to send both his and Doom's consciousnesses to the ''Crossroads of Infinity''.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= DeFalco, Tom|penciller= [[Ron Lim|Lim, Ron]]|inker= [[Scott Koblish|Koblish, Scott]]|story= |title= [[Fantastic Five]]|volume= 2|issue= 5|date= November 2007}}</ref>

===Ultimate Marvel===
In ''[[Ultimate Fantastic Four]]'' #24, the team is surveying the ruins of Atlantis and finds an estimated 9,000-year-old tomb containing the hibernating Namor – an imprisoned Atlantean criminal, considered the worst villain of his time. [[Ultimate Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]]' translation of the Atlantean language reveals Namor's claims of kingship to be false.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Mark Millar|Millar, Mark]]|penciller= [[Greg Land|Land, Greg]]|inker= [[Matt Ryan (comics)|Ryan, Matt]]|story= Tomb of Namor Part 1 of 3|title= [[Ultimate Fantastic Four]]|issue= 24|date= December 2005}}</ref>

His extreme intelligence allows him to become fluent in English in a matter of minutes merely by listening to [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agents and the Fantastic Four talking. Confronting the human, Namor withstands full-strength flares from the [[Alternative versions of the Human Torch#Ultimate Marvel|Human Torch]] and is strong enough to fight the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]], withstand [[Invisible Woman#Ultimate Marvel|Sue Storm]]'s [[force shield|force fields]], and stretch Richards (Mr. Fantastic) to near-breaking.
