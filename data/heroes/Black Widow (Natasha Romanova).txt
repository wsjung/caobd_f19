==Publication history==
[[File:Tales of Suspense 52.jpg|thumb|upright|left|''[[Tales of Suspense]]'' #52 (April 1964), the debut of Black Widow. Cover art by [[Jack Kirby]] and [[Paul Reinman]]]]

The Black Widow's first appearances were as a recurring, non-costumed, [[Russia]]n-[[espionage|spy]] antagonist in the feature "[[Iron Man]]", beginning in ''[[Tales of Suspense]]'' #52 (April 1964). Five issues later, she recruits the besotted costumed archer and later superhero [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]] to her cause. Her government later supplies her with her first Black Widow costume and high-tech weaponry, but she eventually defects to the United States after appearing, temporarily brainwashed against the U.S., in the superhero-team series ''[[The Avengers (comic)|The Avengers]]'' #29 (July 1966). The Widow later becomes a recurring ally of the team before officially becoming its sixteenth member many years later.

The Black Widow was visually updated in 1970: ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #86 (July 1970) reintroduced her with shoulder-length red hair (instead of her former short black hair), a skintight black costume, and wristbands which fired spider threads. This would become the appearance most commonly associated with the character.<ref name="back45">{{cite journal|last= Carson|first= Lex|date= December 2010|title= Daredevil and the Black Widow: A Swinging Couple of Crimefighters|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= 45| pages= 31–38|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref>

In short order, The Black Widow starred in her own series in ''[[Amazing Adventures]]'' #1–8 (Aug. 1970–Sept. 1971), sharing that split book with the feature [[Inhumans]]. The Black Widow feature was dropped after only eight issues (the Inhumans feature followed soon, ending with issue 10).<ref name="back45"/>

Immediately after her initial solo feature ended, the Black Widow co-starred in ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]] '' #81–124 (Nov. 1971–Aug. 1975), of which #93-108 were cover titled ''Daredevil and the Black Widow''. ''Daredevil'' writer [[Gerry Conway]] recounted, "It was my idea to team up Daredevil and the Black Widow, mainly because I was a fan of Natasha, and thought she and Daredevil would have interesting chemistry."<ref name="back45"/> Succeeding writers, however, felt that Daredevil worked better as a solo hero, and gradually wrote the Black Widow out of the series.<ref name="back45"/> She was immediately recast into the super-team series ''[[Champions (1975 team)|The Champions]]'' as the leader of the titular superhero group, which ran for 17 issues (Oct. 1975–Jan. 1978).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Walker|first=Karen|title='We'll Keep on Fighting 'Til the End': The Story of the Champions|journal=[[Back Issue!]] |issue=65|pages=17–23|publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|date=July 2013|location= Raleigh, North Carolina}}</ref>

Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, the Black Widow appeared frequently as both an Avengers member and a freelance agent of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] She starred in a serialized feature within the omnibus comic-book series ''[[Marvel Fanfare]]'' #10–13 (Aug. 1983–March 1984), written by [[George Pérez]] and [[Ralph Macchio (editor)|Ralph Macchio]], with art by [[penciller]] Perez. These stories were later collected in the oversized [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]] ''Black Widow: Web of Intrigue'' #1 (June 1999).

The Widow guest-starred in issues of ''Solo Avengers'', ''[[Force Works]]'', ''Iron Man'', ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'', and other comics. She had made frequent guest appearances in ''Daredevil'' since the late 1970s.

She starred in a three-issue arc, "The Fire Next Time", by writer [[Scott Lobdell]] and penciller Randy Green, in ''[[Journey into Mystery]]'' #517–519 (Feb.–April 1998).

A new ongoing ''Black Widow'' comic title debuted in April 2010. The first story arc was written by [[Marjorie Liu]] with art by [[Daniel Acuna]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=24463 |title=Marvel Comics Solicitations for April 2010 |publisher=Comic Book Resources |accessdate=January 10, 2011}}</ref> Beginning with issue #6 (Sept. 2010), the title was written by [[Duane Swierczynski]], with artwork by [[Manuel Garcia (artist)|Manuel Garcia]] and [[Lorenzo Ruggiero]].

Black Widow appeared as a regular character throughout the 2010–2013 ''[[Secret Avengers]]'' series, from issue #1 (July 2010) through its final issue #37 (March 2013).

Black Widow appears in the 2013 ''Secret Avengers'' series by [[Nick Spencer]] and [[Luke Ross]].<ref name="SecretAvengers">{{cite web |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=41551 |title=NYCC: Spencer's "Secret Avengers" are the Newest Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. |last=Richards |first=Dave |date=14 October 2012 |publisher=Comic Book Resources |accessdate=15 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927115401/http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=41551 |archivedate=September 27, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

===Limited series and specials===
Aside from the arcs in ''Marvel Fanfare'' and ''Journey into Mystery,'' the Black Widow has starred in four [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] and four [[graphic novel]]s.

The three-issue ''Black Widow'' (June - Aug. 1999), under the [[Marvel Knights]] imprint, starred Romanova and fully introduced her appointed successor, [[Black Widow (Yelena Belova)|Captain Yelena Belova]], who had briefly appeared in an issue of the 1999 series ''[[Inhumans]]''. The writer for the story arc, "The Itsy-Bitsy Spider" was [[Devin K. Grayson]] while [[J. G. Jones]] was the artist. The next three-issue, Marvel Knights mini-series, also titled ''Black Widow'' (Jan. - March 2001) featured both Black Widows in the story arc "Breakdown", by writers Devin Grayson and [[Greg Rucka]] with painted art by [[Scott Hampton]].

Romanova next starred in another solo miniseries titled ''Black Widow: Homecoming'' (Nov. 2004 - April 2005), also under the Marvel Knights imprint and written by [[List of science fiction authors|science fiction novelist]] [[Richard Morgan (author)|Richard K. Morgan]], with art initially by [[Bill Sienkiewicz]] and later by Sienkiewicz over Goran Parlov layouts. A six-issue sequel, ''Black Widow: The Things They Say About Her'' (Nov. 2005–April 2006; officially ''Black Widow 2: The Things They Say About Her'' in the series' [[United States Postal Service|postal]] [[indicia (publishing)|indicia]]), by writer Morgan, penciller [[Sean Phillips]], and inker Sienkiewicz, picks up immediately where the previous miniseries left off, continuing the story using many of the same characters.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

She starred in the solo graphic novel ''Black Widow: The Coldest War'' (April 1990), and co-starred in three more: ''[[Punisher]]/Black Widow: Spinning Doomsday's Web'' (Dec. 1992); ''Daredevil/Black Widow: Abattoir'' (July 1993); and ''[[Fury/Black Widow: Death Duty]]'' (June 1995), also co-starring [[Marvel UK]]'s [[Night Raven]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Black Widow is also featured in the short story ''Love Is Blindness'' in ''I Heart Marvel: Marvel Ai'' (2006) #1 (April 2006), where she instigates a humorous fight with [[Elektra (comics)|Elektra]] over Daredevil's affections. The comic is stylized to look like Japanese animation and uses images, not words, inside the speech and thought bubbles to convey what the characters are saying/thinking.

In 2010, the year in which the character, called only Natasha Romanoff, made her film debut in ''[[Iron Man 2]]'', the Black Widow received two separate miniseries. ''Black Widow and the Marvel Girls'' was an all-ages, four-issue series that chronicled her adventures with various women of the Marvel Universe, including [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], [[She-Hulk]], the [[Enchantress (Marvel Comics)|Enchantress]], and [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]]. It was written by Paul Tobin, with art by Salvador Espin and [[Takeshi Miyazawa]]. The second four-issue miniseries, ''Black Widow: Deadly Origin'', was written by [[Paul Cornell]], and featured art by [[Tom Raney]] and [[John Paul Leon]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

==Fictional character biography==

===Early life===
[[File:Avengers36panel.jpg|thumb|upright|left|First costume (and bouffant hairdo). From ''The Avengers'' #36 (Jan. 1967), art by [[Don Heck]].]]
Natasha was born in [[Stalingrad]] (now Volgograd), [[RSFSR|Russia]]. The first and best-known Black Widow is a [[Russians|Russian]] agent trained as a spy, martial artist, and sniper, and outfitted with an arsenal of high-tech weaponry, including a pair of wrist-mounted energy weapons dubbed her "Widow's Bite". She wears no costume during her first few appearances but simply [[formal wear|evening wear]] and a veil. Romanova eventually defects to the U.S. for reasons that include her love for the reluctant-criminal turned superhero [[Archery|archer]], [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]].

First hints to Natalia Romanova's childhood come by Ivan Petrovich, who is introduced as her middle-aged chauffeur and confidant in the Black Widow's 1970s ''[[Amazing Adventures]]''. The man tells [[Matt Murdock]] how he had been given custody of little Natasha by a woman just before her death during the [[Battle of Stalingrad]] in autumn 1942. He had consequently felt committed to raise the orphan as a surrogate father and she had eventually trained as a [[Soviet]] spy, being eager to help her homeland.<ref>''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]'' issue #88 (June 1972)</ref> In another [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]], set in the fictional island of [[Madripoor]] in 1941, Petrovich helps [[Captain America]] and the [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] Logan, who would later become the [[Canadians|Canadian]] super-agent and costumed hero [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], to rescue Natasha from [[Nazism|Nazis]].<ref>''[[Uncanny X-Men|The Uncanny X-Men]]'' issue #268 (Sept. 1990)</ref>

A revised, [[retroactive continuity|retconned]] origin establishes her as being raised from very early childhood by the U.S.S.R.'s "Black Widow Ops" program, rather than solely by Ivan Petrovitch.<ref>''Black Widow'' #1–6 (Nov. 2004–April 2005)</ref> Petrovitch had taken her to Department X, with other young female orphans, where she was [[brainwashing|brainwashed]], and trained in combat and espionage at the covert "[[Red Room (comics)|Red Room]]" facility. There, she is biotechnologically and psycho-technologically enhanced—an accounting that provides a rationale for her unusually long and youthful lifespan. During that time she had some training under [[Bucky Barnes|Winter Soldier]], and the pair even had a short romance.<ref>''[[Captain America]]'' vol. 5, #27 (Aug. 2007)</ref> Each Black Widow is deployed with false memories to help ensure her loyalty. Romanova eventually discovers this, including the fact that she had never, as she had believed, been a [[ballerina]]. She further discovers that the Red Room is still active as "2R".

Natasha was arranged by the KGB to marry the renowned Soviet test pilot [[Red Guardian#Alexei Shostakov|Alexei Shostakov]]. However, when the Soviet government decided to make Alexei into their new operative, the Red Guardian, he is told that he can have no further contact with his wife. Natasha is told that he had died and is trained as a secret agent separately.

===The Avengers===
Romanova grew up to serve as a femme fatale. She was assigned to assist [[Crimson Dynamo#The second Crimson Dynamo|Boris Turgenov]] in the assassination of [[Crimson Dynamo#The original Crimson Dynamo|Professor Anton Vanko]] for defecting from the Soviet Union, which served as her first mission in the United States. Natasha and Turgenov infiltrated [[Stark Industries]] as part of the plan.<ref>''Tales of Suspense'' Vol 1 #52</ref> She attempted to manipulate information from American [[defense contractor]] Tony Stark, and inevitably confronted his superhero alter ego, [[Iron Man]]. The pair then battled Iron Man, and Turgenov steals and wears the Crimson Dynamo suit. Vanko sacrificed himself to save Iron Man, killing Turgenov in the process, using an unstable experimental laser light pistol.<ref>''Tales of Suspense'' #52–53 (Apr. 1964–May 1964)</ref> Romanova later meets the criminal archer [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]] and sets him against Iron Man,<ref>''Tales of Suspense'' #57 (Sept. 1964)</ref> and later helped Hawkeye battle Iron Man.<ref>''Tales of Suspense'' #60 (Dec. 1964)</ref>

Natasha once more attempted to get Hawkeye to help her destroy Iron Man. The pair almost succeeded, but when Black Widow was injured, Hawkeye retreated to get her to safety.<ref>''Tales of Suspense'' #64</ref> During this period, Romanova was attempting to defect from the Soviet Union and began falling in love with Hawkeye, weakening her loyalty to her country. When her employers learned the truth, the [[KGB]] had her gunned down, sending her to a hospital, convincing Hawkeye to go straight and seek membership in the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].<ref>''Avengers'' #12</ref><ref>''Avengers'' #16 (May 1965)</ref>

The Red Room kidnaps and [[brainwashes]] her again, and with the [[Swordsman (comics)#Jacques Duquesne|Swordsman]] and the first [[Erik Josten|Power Man]], she battles the Avengers.<ref>''The Avengers'' #29–30 (June 1966–July 1966)</ref> She eventually breaks free from her psychological conditioning (with the help of Hawkeye), and does successfully defect, having further adventures with Spider-Man, with Hawkeye and with Daredevil.{{issue|date=June 2012}} She ultimately joins the Avengers as a costumed heroine herself.<ref>''The Avengers'' #111 (May 1973)</ref>

===S.H.I.E.L.D. and Daredevil===
[[File:BlackWidow2005No1.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Promotional art for ''Black Widow: The Things They Say About Her'' #1 (Nov. 2005), by [[Bill Sienkiewicz]].]]
Later still, she begins freelancing as an agent of the international espionage group [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] She is sent on a secret S.H.I.E.L.D. mission to China by [[Nick Fury]]. There, with the Avengers, she battles Col. Ling, Gen. Brushov, and her ex-husband the [[Red Guardian#Alexei Shostakov|Red Guardian]].<ref>''The Avengers'' #38–44 (Mar. 1967–Sept. 1967)</ref> For a time, as writer [[Les Daniels]] noted in a contemporaneous study in 1971,

{{quote|text=...&nbsp;her left-wing upbringing was put to better use, and she has lately taken to fighting realistic oppressor-of-the-people types. She helps young [[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Ricans]] clean up police corruption and saves young [[hippies]] from [[organized crime]].&nbsp; ... [The splash page of ''[[Amazing Adventures]]'' #3 (Nov. 1970)] reflects the recent trend toward involving fantastic characters in contemporary social problems, a move which has gained widespread publicity for Marvel and its competitor, [[DC Comics|DC]].<ref>[[Les Daniels|Daniels, Les]]. ''Comix: A History of Comic Books in America'' (Fusion, 1971), pp. 142–143. {{ISBN|0-87690-034-1}}</ref>}}

During her romantic involvement with Matt Murdock in San Francisco, she operates as an independent superhero alongside Murdock's alter ego, [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]].<ref>''Daredevil'' #81 (Nov. 1971)</ref> There she tries unsuccessfully to find a new career for herself as a fashion designer. Eventually, her relationship with Murdock stagnates, and after briefly working with Avengers finally breaks up with Murdock, fearing that playing "[[sidekick]]" is sublimating her identity.<ref>''Daredevil'' #124 (Aug. 1975)</ref> During a HYDRA attempt to take over S.H.I.E.L.D., she is tortured to such an extent that she regresses back to an old cover identity of schoolteacher Nancy Rushman, but she is recovered by [[Spider-Man]] in time to help Nick Fury and [[Shang-Chi]] work out what had happened and restore her memory, with "Nancy" developing an attraction to Spider-Man before her memory is restored during the final fight against Madam Viper, [[Boomerang (comics)|Boomerang]] and the [[Silver Samurai]].<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #82–85 (June 1979–Sept. 1979)</ref> She later returns to Matt Murdock's life to find he is romantically involved with another woman, Heather Glenn,<ref>''Daredevil'' #157 (March 1979)</ref> prompting her to leave New York.<ref>''Daredevil'' #165 (July 1980)</ref> Natasha ultimately realizes that Matt still only thinks of her in platonic terms, and elects to restrain herself from any advances.<ref>''Daredevil'' #190 (Jan. 1983)</ref>

===The Champions===
After their breakup, the Widow moves to Los Angeles and becomes leader of the newly created and short-lived super team known as The Champions, consisting of her, [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|Ghost Rider]] (Johnny Blaze), [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]] (with whom she has a brief romance), and former [[X-Men]] [[Warren Worthington III|Angel]] and [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]].<ref>''Champions'' #1–3 (Oct. 1975–Feb. 1976)</ref>

Her friends usually call her "Natasha", the informal version of "Natalia". She has sometimes chosen the last-name alias "Romanoff"—evidently as a private joke on those who are not aware that Russian family names use [[Eastern Slavic naming customs#Family name (surname)|different endings for males and females]]. She has been hinted to be a descendant of the deposed [[House of Romanov]] and a relation to [[Nicholas II of Russia]].

===21st century===
{{long plot|date=January 2018}}
Natasha crosses Daredevil's (Matt Murdock) path again when he attempts to slay an infant he believes to be the Anti-Christ while under the influence of mind-altering drugs. After Daredevil's one-time love, [[Karen Page]], dies protecting the child, Natasha reconciles with Murdock, revealing she still loves him, but noting that he is too full of anger to commit to a relationship with her.<ref>''Daredevil'' vol. 2, #1–7 (Nov. 1998–May 1999)</ref>

Natasha is challenged by Yelena Belova, a graduate from the training program through which Natasha herself was taught the espionage trade, who is the first to ever surpass Natasha's marks and considers herself the rightful successor to the "Black Widow" mantle.<ref>''Black Widow'' vol. 1, #1</ref> Natasha refers to her as "little one" and "rooskaya (meaning "Russian"), and encourages her to discover her individuality rather than live in blind service, asking her "why be Black Widow, when you can be Yelena Belova?"<ref>''Black Widow'' vol. 1, #2</ref> After several confrontations, Natasha subjects Yelena to intense [[psychological manipulation]] and suffering in order to teach her the reality of the espionage business, and an angry but disillusioned Yelena eventually returns home and temporarily quits being a spy. Although Matt Murdock is appalled by the cruelty of Natasha's treatment of Yelena, [[Nick Fury]] describes the action as Natasha's attempt at saving Yelena's life.<ref>''Black Widow'' Vol. 2 #3</ref> After bringing the Avengers and the Thunderbolts together to overcome Count Nefaria, Natasha supported Daredevil's short-lived efforts to form a new super-team to capture the [[Punisher]], originally believed to be Nick Fury's murderer.{{issue|date=August 2012}} Despite recruitment endeavors, however, this vigilante group folded shortly after she and her teammate Dagger fought an army of renegade S.H.I.E.L.D. androids; ironically, she soon afterward worked with both Daredevil and Punisher against the European crime syndicate managed by the Brothers Grace.{{issue|date=August 2012}} Months later, her pursuit of war criminal Anatoly Krylenko led to a clash with Hawkeye, whose pessimism regarding heroic activities now rivaled her own.{{issue|date=August 2012}}

Shortly after the Scarlet Witch's insanity seemingly killed Hawkeye, and again disbanded the Avengers, Natasha, weary of espionage and adventure, travelled to Arizona but was targeted. Andrea discovers that other women had been trained in the Black Widow Program, and all are now being hunted down and killed{{Issue|date=July 2009}} by the North Institute on behalf of the corporation [[Gynacon]].{{issue|date=August 2012}} Natasha's investigations led her back to Russia, where she was appalled to learn the previously unimagined extent of her past manipulation, and she discovered the Widows were being hunted because Gynacon, having purchased Russian biotechnology from Red Room's successor agency 2R, wanted all prior users of the technology dead. Natasha finds and kills the mastermind of the Black Widow murders: Ian McMasters, Gynacon's aging CEO, who intended to use part of their genetic structure to create a new chemical weapon.{{Issue|date=July 2009}} After killing McMasters, she clashed with operatives of multiple governments to help [[Sally Anne Carter]], a girl Natasha had befriended in her investigations, whom she rescued with help from Daredevil and Yelena Belova.{{issue|date=August 2012}} She soon returned the favor for Daredevil by reluctantly working with Elektra Natchios to protect his new wife, Milla Donovan, from the FBI and others, although Yelena proved beyond help when she agreed to be transformed into the new Super-Adaptoid by [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] and [[Hydra (Marvel Comics)|HYDRA]].{{issue|date=August 2012}}

===Civil War/Initiative===
{{long plot|date=January 2018}}
During the Superhero [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]], Natasha becomes a supporter of the [[Superhuman Registration Act]] and a member of the taskforce led by Iron Man.<ref>''[[Civil War (comic book)|Civil War]]'' #3 (Sept. 2006)</ref> Afterward, the registered Natasha joins the reconstituted [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].{{issue|date=September 2014}} S.H.I.E.L.D. director [[Nick Fury]] is presumed killed,{{issue|date=September 2014}} and deputy director [[Maria Hill]] incapacitated,{{issue|date=September 2014}} so Natasha assumes temporary command of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] as the highest-ranking agent present.{{issue|date=September 2014}}

Later, Tony Stark assigns Natasha to convey the late [[Captain America]]'s [[Captain America's shield|shield]] to a secure location, but is intercepted by her former lover, [[Bucky Barnes]], the Winter Soldier, who steals the shield. Natasha and the [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]] then rescue Barnes from the [[Red Skull]]'s minions, and bring him to the [[Helicarrier|S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier]], where Stark convinces Bucky to become the new Captain America. Afterward, Natasha accompanies Bucky as his partner for a brief time until she is called back by S.H.I.E.L.D.<ref>''Captain America'' vol. 5, #27–34 (Aug. 2007–March 2008)</ref> She later rejoins him and Falcon for the final confrontation with the Red Skull, helping to rescue [[Sharon Carter]].

===Thunderbolts===
{{long plot|date=January 2018}}

[[Norman Osborn]] discovered [[Black Widow (Yelena Belova)|Yelena Belova]] breaking into an abandoned [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] facility, and offered her the position of field leader of the new [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]. On her first mission, she and Ant-Man take control of [[Air Force One]] with the Goblin, [[Doc Samson]], and the [[Barack Obama|new President]] aboard.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #128 (Mar. 2009)</ref> It was suggested she faked her apparent death (as the Adaptoid) but it is never explained how.

A conversation with the [[Ghost (Marvel Comics)|Ghost]] implies that Yelena is working as a mole for someone else and that she may even be someone else disguised as Yelena. She is later seen talking privately through a comm-link to [[Nick Fury]].<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #133 (Aug. 2009)</ref>

Osborn orders Yelena to lead the current Thunderbolts to kill former Thunderbolt, [[Songbird (comics)|Songbird]].

===Secret Wars===
{{long plot|date=January 2018}}

During the [[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|incursion event between Earth-616 and Earth-1610]], Natasha is involved in the final battle between the Marvel Universe's superheroes and the Ultimate Universe's Children of Tomorrow. She pilots a ship holding a handpicked few to restart humanity after the universe ends, copiloted by [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Jessica Drew]]. Her ship is shot down during the battle though, and she is killed in the ensuing explosion.<ref>''Secret Wars'' #1</ref>

As the evacuation of Earth-616 begins in light of the fact that Earth-1610 is about to come crashing down as part of the "Last Days" storyline, Black Widow is seen standing atop a building with Captain America who gives her a list of people to save and bring aboard the lifeboat. As she tells Sam she can't save them all, Sam explains it's Natasha's job to assist in the effort to save as many people as possible before Earth as they know it is destroyed. As she leaves, her mind transitions to [[Cold War]] Russia, where a young Natasha (here called Natalia) speaks with two Russian functionaries in the infamous "Red Room". She is given her first mission: travel to Cuba and locate a family called the Comienzas, who are at risk from [[Raúl Castro]]'s regime and who may have information of vital importance to Russia. She is told to rendezvous with another agent, her classmate Marina, and befriend the family under the guise of a Russian businesswoman. Natasha assures them of her competency and leaves. When one of the officers questions her youth, the other assures him, "she's a killer. She will not disappoint." Natasha meets Marina in Cuba and the two friends catch up before meeting with the Comienzas that night at a local bar. Using her talent for deception, she casually and politely convinces the husband and wife that she's seeking inside information to help her import various goods into the country. The Comienzas explain they can't reveal said information, prompting Natasha to later explain to Marina that the family might need "a little push". Not too soon she effectively began terrorizing the family into desperation. First, she plants an American flag on their doorstep to mimic someone accusing them of defecting to the United States. Later after meeting with one of the Russian officers from the Red Room to report her progress, she detonated a car bomb outside their home when the first attempt didn't make them "nearly desperate enough". Following the car bomb explosion, Natasha declares the family is indeed desperate enough to reproach for information. Before letting Natasha go, the officer announces she has one additional task before her mission is over: Marina has become too much enamored with her civilian guise, and is now a security risk. Natasha will have to eliminate her.<ref>''Black Widow'' Vol. 5 #19</ref> Flipping to the present, Black Widow is saving as many people as she can, but she quickly flashback to Havana. Natasha and her then Red Room partner Marina are trying to help a family defect. Natasha's orders are simple: Kill the parents and make it public. When Natasha asks if she should kill the child too, her boss looks horrified that she would be so OK with that and tells her no. Having no problem following orders she sets up a meet and using a sniper rifle she takes out the pair without blinking. Next she shoots Marina's boyfriend then Marina herself. Next she shoots Marina's cat. Flipping back to the present, Black Widow is back saving people from the incursion as the reason that triggered Natasha's flashback is revealed ... a man she saved is holding his cat. This dark, heartless side of the Black Widow shows why she is trying so hard to do good today.<ref>''Black Widow'' Vol. 5 #20</ref>

===Secret Empire===
{{long plot|date=January 2018}}

During the "[[Secret Empire (comics)|Secret Empire]]" storyline, Black Widow appears as a member of the underground resistance at the time when most of the United States has been taken over by Hydra and Captain America who was brainwashed by Red Skull's clone using the powers of the sentient [[Cosmic Cube]] [[List of Marvel Comics characters: K#Kobik|Kobik]] into believing that he was a Hydra sleeper agent.<ref>''Secret Empire'' #1</ref> While Hawkeye assembles a strike force of Hercules and Quicksilver to find the Cosmic Cube fragments, Black Widow sets off to kill Rogers herself reasoning that even if Rick's theory is true, the man Rogers was would prefer to die than be used in this manner. She finds herself followed by the [[Champions (2016 team)|Champions]] as she establishes her version of the Red Room.<ref>''Secret Empire'' #2</ref> While preparing to shoot Captain America with a sniper rifle, she rushes to prevent [[Spider-Man (Miles Morales)|Miles Morales]] from killing him as predicted by [[Ulysses (comics)#Ulysses Cain|Ulysses]],<ref>''Civil War II'' #5</ref> and is struck by his shield, breaking her neck and killing her.<ref>''Secret Empire'' #7</ref> Despite the return of the real Steve Rogers and the downfall of Hydra, Natasha's death, along with other casualties, remains.<ref>''Secret Empire'' #10</ref>

===Clone of Natasha Romanova===
However, while observing a dictator who recently rose to power due to his support of Hydra, Bucky witnesses the man being assassinated in such a manner that he believes only Natasha could have pulled off the kill, and believes he sees the Black Widow depart from her chosen vantage point.<ref>''Secret Empire: Omega'' #1</ref>

It was later discovered that Black Widow was actually cloned by the Black Widow Ops Program following her death. Its member Ursa Major bribed Epsilon Red to let him add her current memories while secretly disposing of the bad programming. The Black Widow Ops Program tasked the clone into taking out the remnants of Hydra and S.H.I.E.L.D.<ref>''Tales of Suspense'' #103. Marvel Comics.</ref> She revealed herself to Winter Soldier and Hawkeye while also killing Orphan Maker. To keep them from interfering, the Black Widow clone locked Winter Soldier and Hawkeye in a safe room within the Red Room.<ref>''Tales of Suspsense'' #100-103. Marvel Comics.</ref> The Black Widow clone rose to the ranks of the Red Room while secretly persuading the recruits to turn against their masters. When Winter Soldier and Hawkeye arrived at the Red Room, the Black Widow clone dropped her cover where she began to kill her superiors, liberate the recruits, and destroy all the clones and Epsilon Red. When the authorities arrived, Black Widow left the Red Room where she left a note for Hawkeye to stop following her and for Winter Soldier to join her in ending the Red Room.<ref>''Tales of Suspense'' #104. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[Infinity Countdown]]" storyline, the Black Widow clone traced a dead drop signal left by a revived Wolverine in Madripoor. She discovered that Wolverine had left the Space Infinity Gem in her care.<ref>''Infinity Countdown'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> The Black Widow clone meets up with Doctor Strange who wants to dispose of the Space Stone. Doctor Strange did not want to take it as he knows what would happen if they are in the same proximity. She is among the Infinity Gem holders who are contacted by Doctor Strange stating that they need to reform the [[Infinity Watch]] in order to safeguard the Infinity Gems from such calamities like Thanos.<ref>''Infinity Countdown'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Captain America had Black Widow's clone infiltrate Roxxon as an ex-S.H.I.E.L.D. operative-turned-contractor named Angel to spy on Roxxon and keep an eye on [[Weapon H]]. As Angel, she accompanied Weapon H and his assigned team to Weirdworld up to the point where Morgan le Fay of Earth-15238 exposed her identity to Weapon H.<ref>''Weapon H'' #8-10. Marvel Comics.</ref> After getting out of the wreckage of the Roxxon Resarch Outpost, Black Widow reveals to Blake that she was sent to get the Roxxon group out of Weirdworld. Dr. Carrie Espinoza and the Roxxon soldiers with her salvage a Weirdworld Adamantine Crystal filled with Morgan le Fay's mystic energies which Dr. Esponoza states to Black Widow and Blake that it can power all of New York for 10 years. As the group arrives near the Inaku village, they witness Weapon H fighting Korg as Black Widow is contacted by Sonia Sung from Roxxon's headquarters. Black Widow tries to help Sonia get through to Weapon H until [[Minotaur (comics)|Dario Agger]] arrives.<ref>''Weapon H'' #11. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The Black Widow has been enhanced by biotechnology that makes her body resistant to aging and disease and heals at an above human rate;<ref>''Black Widow: Breakdown'' #2 (Feb. 2001)</ref> as well as psychological conditioning that suppresses her memory of true events as opposed to implanted ones of the past without the aid of specially designed system suppressant drugs.{{Issue|date=June 2010}}

The [[white blood cell]]s in her body are efficient enough to fight off any microbe, foreign body and others from her body, keeping her healthy and immune to most, if not all infections, diseases and disorders.{{issue|date=June 2012}}

Her agility is greater than that of an Olympic gold medalist. She can coordinate her body with balance, flexibility, and dexterity easily.<ref>''[[Black Widow (Marvel Comics)|Black Widow]]'' #6 (Feb. 2005)</ref>

Romanova has a gifted intellect.<ref name="handbook"/> She displays an uncanny affinity for [[psychological manipulation]] and can mask her real emotions perfectly. Like [[Captain America|Steve Rogers]], she possesses the ability to quickly process multiple information streams (such as [[threat assessment]]) and rapidly respond to changing tactical situations.<ref name="handbook"/>

The Black Widow is a world class athlete, gymnast, acrobat, aerialist capable of numerous complex maneuvers and feats, expert martial artist (including [[Jiu jitsu]], [[Aikido]],<ref name=":0" /> [[Boxing]],<ref name=":0" /> [[Judo]],<ref name=":0" /> [[Karate]],<ref name=":0" /> [[Savate]],<ref name=":0">''Daredevil/Black Widow: Abattoir'' #1</ref> [[Ninjutsu]],<ref>''Thunderbolts'' (vol 1) #131 (June 2009)</ref> various styles of [[Kung Fu]] and [[Kenpo]]), [[marksman]] and weapons specialist as well as having extensive espionage training.<ref name="BW:DO2">''Black Widow: Deadly Origin'' #2 (Feb. 2010)</ref> She is also an accomplished [[ballerina]].

Romanova is an expert tactician. She is a very effective strategist, tactician, and field commander. She has led the Avengers and even S.H.I.E.L.D. on one occasion.<ref name="handbook"/>

===Equipment===
The Black Widow uses a variety of equipment invented by Soviet scientists and technicians, with later improvements by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] scientists and technicians. She usually wears distinctively shaped bracelets which fire the [[Widow's Bite]] electro-static energy blasts that can deliver charges up to 30,000 volts, as well as "Widow's Line" grappling hooks, tear gas pellets, and a new element introduced during her ongoing series during the "Kiss or Kill" arc called the "Widow's Kiss"—an aerosol instant knock-out gas she has modified.<ref name="handbook">All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Hardcover, Volume 2</ref> She wears a belt of metallic discs; some are disc-charges containing plastic explosives, while others have been shown to be compartments for housing other equipment. Her costume consists of synthetic stretch fabric equipped with micro-suction cups on fingers and feet, enabling her to adhere to walls and ceilings. In the 2006 "Homecoming" mini-series, she was seen using knives, unarmed combat, and various firearms, but she has since begun using her bracelets again.<ref name="handbook"/> While in disguise as Yelena Belova, when infiltrating the then Osborn-sanctioned Thunderbolts during "Dark Reign", she used a specialized multi-lens goggle/head-carapace that demonstrated various technical abilities enhancing vision and communication.{{Issue|date=February 2011}} Later, she has used a modified gun based on her Widow's Bite wrist cartridge, during her adventures alongside the new [[Captain America]].<ref name="BW:DO2"/>
