The '''Destroyer''' is the name of three [[fictional character|fictional]] [[superhero]]es appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. One of the earliest creations of major comics-industry figure [[Stan Lee]], the original incarnation [[first appeared]] in the 1940s during what historians and fans call the [[Golden Age of Comics|Golden Age of comic books]]. Modern incarnations created by [[Roy Thomas]] and [[Frank Robbins]] appeared in ''[[Invaders (comics)|Invaders]]'' #18 (July 1977), and ''Invaders'' #26 (March 1978). The ''[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe]]'' clarifies that all three versions of the character are considered canon.<ref>''Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z Vol. 3''</ref>

==Publication history==

===Golden Age publications===
The Destroyer [[first appearance|first appeared]] as the cover subject and in a story in ''[[Mystic Comics]]'' #6 (Oct. 1941), from [[Marvel Comics]]' predecessor [[Timely Comics]]. One of the [[World War II]]-era heroes of what fans and historians call the [[Golden Age of Comic Books]], the character was one of the first co-created by Marvel writer-editor [[Stan Lee]]. According to comics historian and former Marvel editor-in-chief [[Roy Thomas]], "Stan's most popular [[superhero]] creation before the [[Fantastic Four]] was the Destroyer."<ref>''The Golden Age of Marvel Comics'' (Marvel, 1997; {{ISBN|0-7851-0564-6}}) Introduction, p. 3</ref> The artist co-creator is uncertain: the story [[penciler]]-[[inker]] was [[Jack Binder (comics)|Jack Binder]], but the cover artist, who may have drawn the character first, was [[Alex Schomburg]].<ref>[http://www.comics.org/details.lasso?id=1711 ''Mystic Comics'' #6] at the [[Grand Comics Database]]</ref>

The Destroyer ran as the cover feature of ''Mystic'' #6 and of the remaining four issues of that 10-issue superhero [[anthology]], and while less popular than the company's [[Captain America]], the [[Human Torch (android)|Human Torch]], and the [[Sub-Mariner]], he went on to star in issues of nearly every Timely superhero comic-book series — becoming the company's most-published character outside of those three stars and the [[Angel (Thomas Halloway)|Angel]].

The Destroyer stood out from other wartime heroes in that he operated solely within [[occupied Europe]].<ref>{{cite journal|last= Thomas|first= Roy|date= August 2011|title= Destroy All Nazis!|journal= [[Alter Ego (magazine)|Alter Ego]]|issue= 104| page= 24|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref> Artists associated with the feature include pencilers [[Al Gabriele]] and [[Mike Sekowsky]], and inkers [[Vince Alascia]] and [[Allen Bellman]]. Comic-book giant [[Jack Kirby]] contributed the Destroyer cover of ''Mystic Comics'' #7 (Dec. 1941).<ref>[http://comics.org/details.lasso?id=1843 ''Mystic Comics'' #7] at the Grand Comics Database.</ref><ref>[http://www.kirbymuseum.org/catalogue/view.jkm?pp=3797 Destroyer cover, ''Mystic Comics'' #7]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} at the [[Jack Kirby]] Museum</ref> The cover was inked by either [[Syd Shores]] or [[Joe Simon]] (sources differ).

===1970s Publications===
[[Roy Thomas]] and [[Frank Robbins]] first featured Roger Aubrey as the diminutive [[Dyna-Mite]] in ''[[Invaders (comics)|Invaders]]'' #14-15 (March–April 1977); in the story he is part of a group of the predominantly British superhero group the Crusaders, who are being manipulated by the Nazis into killing the British King. He returns in Thomas and Robbins' ''Invaders'' #18-21 (July–October 1977); in the story he parachutes into Nazi Germany with [[Union Jack (comics)|Lord Falsworth]] and [[Spitfire (comics)|Spitfire]] on a mission to restore his memory; a flashback reveals that he and his best friend Brian Falsworth had gone to Berlin on a peace mission which ended with them in a Nazi prison where he was experimented on.

Thomas and Robbins also featured the Falsworth incarnation of the Destroyer in ''Invaders'' #18-19 (July–August 1977); in the story he explains how he received a variation of the super-soldier formula from a fellow inmate of a Nazi prison; the previous incarnation as Marlow is [[retroactive continuity|retconed]] as a mistaken FBI theory popularized in comic books. Thomas and Robbins concluded the plot-line in ''The Invaders'' #20-21 (September–October 1977); in the story he abandons his role as the Destroyer and takes over his father's role of [[Union Jack (comics)|Union Jack]] to rescue his sister and the rest of the team while Aubrey helps to steal a plane to get them home, and in ''Invaders'' #22 (November 1977); in which they are both safely returned to England. Thomas and Robbins also featured Falsworth as Union Jack in ''[[What If (comics)|What If?]]'' #4 (August 1977); in the story he and Spitfire save [[Winston Churchill]] from a Nazi assassination attempt.

Thomas and Robbins continued to feature Falsworth and Aubrey in the series, with the former becoming a semi-permanent member of the team in his new role as Union Jack with issues #23 (December 1977) & #25 (February 1978); in which he joins them on his first mission, while the latter appeared in a supporting role as Dyna-Mite in issue #23 (December 1977); in which he searches for a cure for the Nazi experimentation that has reduced his size, and #26 (March 1978); in which a restored Aubrey is introduced in his role as the new Destroyer. This incarnation was also featured by Thomas, Donald Glut and Alan Kupperberg in ''Invaders'' #34 (November 1978) and by Glut, Kupperberg and Charles Eber Stone in ''Invaders'' #41 (September 1979).

===1980s publications===
[[Roger Stern]] and [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] mentioned Falsworth in the backstory for ''[[Captain America]]'' Vol. 1 #253-254 (January–February 1981); the story reveals in a flashback that he died in a car crash in 1953.

===1990s publications===
[[Dan Slott]] and James W. Fry III featured Aubrey in the World War II-era story ''Enis Nacht'' for ''Marvel Comics Presents'' volume 1 #156 (June 1994); in the story he guides a British bomber to its Nazi target. Slott and Fry featured him in another World War II-era story for ''[[Midnight Sons Unlimited]]'' #9 (May 1995); in the story he helps the [[Blazing Skull]] to infiltrate a Nazi base.

===2000s publications===
Aubrey appears as a supporting character in [[Fabian Nicieza]] and Lewis LaRosa's ''[[V-Battalion|Citizen V and the V-Battalion: The Everlasting]]'' #1 (March 2002); the story begins with a flashback showing him at Falsworth's funeral in 1953.

[[Allan Jacobsen (comics)|Allan Jacobsen]] and C.P. Smith used Aubrey as a supporting character in a number of volumes ''New Invaders'', including, #2 (November 2004), in which he is claimed to be one of the new team's first recruits, #4-5 (January–February 2005), which sees him battling the vampiric Baroness Blood alongside Union Jack; and #9 (June 2005), which sees him resuming command of V-Battalion following the death of the original Human Torch.

==Fictional character biographies==

===Keen Marlow===
[[People of the United States|American]] [[journalist]] Keen Marlow is captured for [[spying]] while reporting behind-the-lines in [[Nazism|Nazi]] [[Germany]]. While imprisoned in a [[concentration camp]]—that specific phrase being used before its association with the [[Holocaust]]—Marlow is given a [[Supersoldier|super-soldier]] serum, similar to that given to [[Captain America]], by fellow prisoner Professor Eric Schmitt, an anti-Nazi German [[scientist]]. Responding to the chemical (and without the beneficial "Vita-Rays" used to chemically stabilize Captain America's serum), Marlow becomes a prime human specimen who escapes, dons a sleek, dark costume with a skull motif and a skintight blue mask that made him appear inhuman, and adopts a fearsome identity with which he fights the Nazis on their own turf. He was occasionally abetted by an [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] agent named Florence von Banger. Antagonists included the Scar, Herr Sin and Von Maus.

===Brian Falsworth===
{{main article|Union Jack (comics)}}

In the Destroyer's [[retcon]] appearances in the 1970s, the same origin is recounted except for his identity. Now he is '''Brian Falsworth''', brother of [[Spitfire (comics)|Spitfire]] (a member of the [[World War II]] superhero group the [[Invaders (comics)|Invaders]]) and son of James Montgomery Falsworth, Lord Falsworth, who had been the [[World War I]] hero [[Union Jack (comics)|Union Jack]]. In this storyline, when Captain America asked if the Destroyer is or is not "an American named Keen Marlow," Falsworth declined to respond.

===Roger Aubrey===
Brian Falsworth gave up the Destroyer identity in order to become the new [[Union Jack (comics)|Union Jack]], and his friend [[Destroyer (Roger Aubrey)|Roger Aubrey]] (initially introduced as the superhero Dyna-Mite, a member of the team the [[Crusaders (Marvel Comics)|Crusaders]]<ref>''Invaders'' #14</ref>) became the new Destroyer. Falsworth's story is recounted in passing in [[Ed Brubaker]]'s 2009–2010 miniseries ''[[The Marvels Project]]'' as part of the Angel's diary of the war. This retelling claims that "Keen Marlow" was an alias used by Falsworth to enter Germany to spy; he was betrayed and captured, and then empowered well after Captain America.<ref>''The Marvels Project'' #7</ref> However, prior established continuity showed that Falsworth entered Germany under his real name pre-war to promote appeasement, that he was captured trying to leave Germany shortly after Poland was invaded, and empowered only days later, more than a year before Steve Rogers became Captain America.<ref>''The Invaders'' #19</ref>

==Other versions==
Versions of the Destroyer, both in continuity and out, have appeared in various Marvel comics. ''The Age of the [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|Sentry]]'' #5 (March 2009) depicts the character as a member of the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]. The character also made a guest appearance in a 2000s issue of ''[[New Invaders]]''.

===MAX imprint===
Marvel's [[MAX (comics)|MAX]] [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]] published the five-issue [[miniseries]] ''The Destroyer'' vol. 4 (June-Oct. 2009).<ref>Per ''The Unofficial Handbook of Marvel Comics Creators'', [http://www.maelmill-insi.de/UHBMCC/seldn.htm#G216 volumes one to three] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090808211255/http://www.maelmill-insi.de/UHBMCC/seldn.htm |date=2009-08-08 }} star an unrelated, non-Marvel character adapted from ''[[The Destroyer (fiction)|The Destroyer]]'' &nbsp;series of crime novels: ''The Destroyer'' (1989-1990), ''The Destroyer'' vol. 2 (1991) and ''The Destroyer'' vol. 3 (1991-1992)</ref> Written by [[Robert Kirkman]] and drawn by [[Cory Walker]], it starred a version of the character Keene Marlow depicted, according to Kirkman, under "the assumption that he's had an ongoing series since the '40s, so I'm basically writing 'issues #701-#705' ..."<ref>Rogers, Vaneta. [http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=154261 NYCC '08: Robert Kirkman on Destroyer MAX], ''[[Newsarama]]'', April 19, 2008. [https://www.webcitation.org/5lZ39OFsi?url=http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t%3D154261 WebCite archive] 2009-11-26</ref> In this series, a still-active but elderly Marlowe discovers he has a limited amount of time before he will suffer a fatal [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]], and sets out to kill his old enemies and anyone else who might threaten his wife Harriet, who is [[African-American|black]] and has a [[bionic arm]], or their grown daughter Felecia.<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=20125 "Destroyer Will Punch a Hole in Your Head"], ''[[Comic Book Resources]]'', February 20, 2009. [https://www.webcitation.org/5lZ3G9xY2?url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page%3Darticle%26id%3D20125 WebCite archive] 2009-11-26</ref>

Keene Marlow (his first name slightly different from the earlier comics' "Keen") is enhanced by a super-soldier serum variant, similar to the one used to create [[Captain America]] (Steve Rogers), but lacking the Vita-Ray treatment.  His former [[sidekick]] Turret (Darius Mitchell) is married to Felecia and takes over the role of the Destroyer when Marlow retires.
