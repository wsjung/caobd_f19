'''Caiera''' is a [[fictional character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character was introduced during the "[[Planet Hulk]]" storyline. She first appeared in ''[[Incredible Hulk]]'' vol. 2 #92 (April [[2006 in comics|2006]]), and was created by [[Greg Pak]] and [[Carlo Pagulayan]].

==Fictional character biography==
Caiera was born on [[Sakaar]] to a tribe of Shadow People, the creators of the Old Power. She was raised by the priests to be a shadow warrior. When she was thirteen, her village was attacked by alien "spikes" that caused the other villagers to mutate into monsters. Caiera, the only survivor, was rescued by the Red Prince.

When the Red Prince becomes the Red King, Caiera is his loyal lieutenant and the mother of his daughter. When the [[Incredible Hulk|Hulk]] arrives on Sakaar and gains public support as a gladiator, she protects the Red King from him. After a failed attempt to ruin his popularity, the Hulk and his [[Warbound]] escape.

Caiera is sent to kill the Hulk, but they encounter spikes during their battle. The Red King reveals he controls the spikes, devastating her.  She turns against the Red King and aids the Hulk in a coup. Hulk becomes the Green King, and he marries Caiera. She becomes pregnant, but appears to die in an explosion.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #104</ref><ref>''Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #105</ref> Hulk returned to Earth in [[World War Hulk]].<ref>''World War Hulk'' #1-5</ref>

Caiera survived, however, and gave birth to two sons, [[Skaar (character)|Skaar]] and [[Hiro-Kala]], who serve under her as royal generals.<ref>''Skaar: Son of Hulk'' #8</ref><ref>''Skaar: Son of Hulk'' #10</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Caiera possessed abilities that were derived from the planet itself. She could transform her body into stone and become incredibly resistant and strong, to the extent that she battled the Hulk to a standstill even when his strength and fighting skills had dramatically increased. She was also an expert fighter and tactician.

==Other versions==
A special issue of the series [[What If (comics)|''What If?'']] examined what would have happened if Caiera had survived the explosion instead of Hulk.

Angered at the loss of her husband, Caiera takes the entirety of her planet's energies into herself, vastly increasing her power. She then goes to Earth to avenge his death. She kills the [[Illuminati (comics)|Illuminati]] and enslaves Earth.

==In other media==
Caiera appears in the animated [[direct-to-video]] film ''[[Planet Hulk (film)|Planet Hulk]]'', voiced by [[Lisa Ann Beley]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marvel.toonzone.net/news.php?action=fullnews&id=460 |title=Animated "''Planet Hulk''" Cast And Crew Details, "''Hulk Versus''" 2009 Year-End Sales |author=James Harvey |date=December 25, 2009 |work=Marvel Animation Age |accessdate=September 8, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131225210859/http://marvel.toonzone.net/news.php?action=fullnews&id=460 |archivedate=December 25, 2013 |df= }}</ref> She follows the Red King loyally because he saved her from the Spikes that destroyed her village and her family. However, it later turns out that the Red King was the one who created the Spikes, thus he is responsible for destroying Caiera's village and killing her people. Once the truth is revealed, Caiera angrily severs her loyalty to the Red King and aids the Hulk and the Warbound into defeating him. Caiera then plants a Spike bug on the Red King, leaving him to be killed by his Death Guard robots (as part of their programming to kill any Spike infestation) as revenge for her tragedy. She then goes on to becoming the Queen Consort to Hulk, who accepts his new role as the new King of Sakaar.
