'''Sif''' is a fictional character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character is depicted commonly in association with the [[superhero]] [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]. Based on the [[Norse mythology|Norse]] [[List of Germanic deities|goddess]] [[Sif]], she was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]] and first appeared in ''Journey Into Mystery'' #102 (March 1964). As an [[Asgard (comics)|Asgardian]] warrior and lover of Thor, Sif often accompanies Thor into battle. She has also battled alongside [[Balder (comics)|Balder]], who has developed an unrequited attraction to her, as she never shows affection for anyone but Thor and certain individuals who have proved worthy to wield his hammer, [[Mjolnir (comics)|Mjolnir]], such as the noble alien warrior [[Beta Ray Bill]] and the mortal [[Thunderstrike (Eric Masterson)|Eric Masterson]]. 

Sif has appeared in various media adaptations of Thor, including the 2011 [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] film ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]'', its 2013 sequel ''[[Thor: The Dark World]]'', and the television series ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'', in which she is portrayed by [[Jaimie Alexander]].

==Publication history==
Created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]], Sif first appeared in ''[[Journey Into Mystery]]'' #102 (March 1964). As a supporting character of Thor, she was featured predominantly in the pages of ''The Mighty Thor'', beginning with issue #136 (January 1967). The character went on to make guest appearances in several series including ''[[The Avengers (comic book)|The Avengers]]'', ''[[Fantastic Four (comic book)|Fantastic Four]]'', ''[[New Mutants|The New Mutants]]'', ''[[Silver Surfer (comic book)|Silver Surfer]]'' and ''[[Thunderstrike (Eric Masterson)|Thunderstrike]]''.

In June 2010, Sif starred in a self-titled [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]] by writer [[Kelly Sue DeConnick]] and artist [[Ryan Stegman]]. The issue deals with the aftermath of Loki having taken control of her body and her consciousness being forced into the frame of a dying elderly woman. DeConnick said, "Well, this is pretty much the story of how she deals with that. She was a bit cowed at first and, for a woman as fierce and proud as Sif, that's insult added to injury. This is the story of how she comes to own that fury and rises to her full stature once again."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://marvel.com/news/story/11465/sifs_revenge |title=Sif's Revenge |last=Dietsch |first=TJ |date=25 February 2010 |publisher=Marvel.com |accessdate=6 December 2012}}</ref>

Beginning with issue #646 (November 2012), ''Journey into Mystery'' by [[Kathryn Immonen]] and [[Valerio Schiti]] shifted focus from Loki to Sif. Editor Lauren Sankovitch said, "We had it Loki-centric... going forward with #646 we wanted to mix it up a little bit. Sif's been in the thick of it, she's a born warrior, she's got a lot of fight and verve and fire to her! We talked at length about what this story could be and what her story could be, and it all came down to...one single question: what does she want? I think Sif, above all, wants to be a better warrior."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=40445 |title=Immonen Leads Sif On A "Journey Into Mystery" |last=Campbell |first=Josie |date=14 August 2012 |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |accessdate=14 August 2012}}</ref> The series was cancelled in August 2013 with issue #655. About the cancellation, Immonen said, <blockquote>We are done with 655. But seeing as we were basically cooked right out of the gate, I'm going to call hanging in for nearly a year a success. To be truthful, the real challenge that we inherited with this book was living up to the beautiful work that [[Kieron Gillen|Kieron [Gillen]]] et al. had done previously and the amazing reader energy that had been generated. If all that had happened with our ten issues was to extend the influence of the astonishing Valerio Schiti, that would have been enough. As it is, I'm so proud of what Valerio, Jordie [Bellaire], Clayton [Cowles], Pepe and I put on the page under Lauren [Sankovitch] and Jake's fearless leadership. I'm also thrilled to have been able to write Sif as a fierce warrior and a lovable dork. I hope she finds a new home somewhere with a lot of things to say and a lot of things to kill.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/06/14/marvel-cancels-journey-into-mystery |title=Marvel Cancels Journey Into Mystery  |last=Schedeen |first=Jesse |date=14 June 2013 |publisher=IGN |accessdate=22 August 2013}}</ref></blockquote>

==Fictional character biography==

===Early life===
Sif, [[Heimdall (comics)|Heimdall]]'s sister,<ref name="thorsoa3">''[[Thor: Son of Asgard]]'' #3 (June 2004)</ref> has been Thor and Balder's constant companion since childhood.<ref name="thorsoa1">''Thor: Son of Asgard'' #1 (May 2004)</ref> Like most Asgardians, Sif was born with golden hair. Hers was turned black after [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] cut it and replaced it with enchanted hair made by dwarves.<ref name="thorsoa8">''Thor: Son of Asgard'' #8 (Nov. 2004)</ref> At an early age she showed great prowess as a warrior and was considered the best female warrior in all of Asgard, matched only by [[Valkyrie (Marvel Comics)|Brunnhilde]]. At one point a giant gave her to the death goddess [[Hela (comics)|Hela]] in exchange for immortality, but Thor saved her by offering himself in her place. Hela was so impressed that she let them both go.<ref name="thorsoa1012">''Thor: Son of Asgard'' #10–12 (Jan. – Mar. 2005)</ref>

Sif was originally said to be Balder's sister rather than Heimdall's in her first appearance.<ref>''Journey Into Mystery'' #102</ref>

===Life as a warrior===
Sif and Thor are separated when his father [[Odin (comics)|Odin]] banishes Thor from Asgard and Thor begins a life as a superhero on Earth. Many years later Thor becomes romantically involved with [[Jane Foster (comics)|Jane Foster]]. Thor brings Jane to Asgard to be wed, and she is granted immortality but fails a final test. Odin sends her back to Earth, stripped of her newly acquired powers and without memories of the event. Odin then arranges an encounter with Sif while Thor is battling the monstrous super-strong Unknown, and the two fall in love again.<ref name="thor136">''Thor'' #136 (Jan. 1967)</ref>

Reunited with Thor, Sif accompanies him into battle against many of his most formidable enemies including [[Ulik]],<ref name="thor136"/><ref name="thor137140">''Thor'' #137–140 (Feb. – May 1967)</ref> the [[Enchanters Three]],<ref name="thor143145">''Thor'' #143–145 (Aug. – Oct. 1967)</ref> the [[Circus of Crime]],<ref name="thor145147">''Thor'' #145–147 (Oct. – Dec. 1967)</ref> [[Wrecker (comics)|Wrecker]],<ref name="thor148150">''Thor''  #148–150 (Jan. – Mar. 1968)</ref> [[Mangog]],<ref name="thor154157">''Thor'' #154–157 (July – Oct. 1968)</ref> [[Pluto (Marvel Comics)|Pluto]],<ref name="thor163164">''Thor'' #163–164 (Apr. – May 1969)</ref> and [[Surtur (Marvel Comics)|Surtur]].<ref name="thor176177">''Thor'' #176–177 (May – June 1970)</ref> Sif is part of the resistance when Loki takes control of Asgard. After [[Hogun the Grim]] attempts a physical attack, Sif puts herself in the line of fire and convinces Loki if he dies, he would have to kill her too. Loki declines to murder anyone at that point.<ref>''Thor'' Vol 1 #192 (September 1971)</ref> Sif is one of the Asgardians who encounter [[Tana Nile]], leading to a series of adventures with her that gets them exiled from Asgard for a time, but they eventually return home.<ref name="thor201221">''Thor'' #201–221 (July 1972 – Mar. 1974)</ref> Sif discovers that Thor still has feelings for Jane Foster when she finds him at her hospital bedside after Jane has been critically injured.<ref name="thor231">''Thor'' #231 (Jan. 1975)</ref> Despite this, Sif chooses to save Jane's life by merging her life force with her own. Sif does this partially to try to understand Thor's attraction to mortals, especially Jane.<ref name="thor236">''Thor'' #236 (June 1975)</ref> Sif is soon separated from Jane, and Jane is exiled to a [[pocket dimension]] only accessible through the [[Possessor (comics)|Possessor]]'s runestaff.<ref name="thor249">''Thor'' #249 (July 1976)</ref> Eventually, Sif and Thor rescue Jane and reunite her with her mortal love, Dr. Kevin Kincaid.<ref name="thor334335">''Thor'' #334–335 (Aug. – Sept. 1983)</ref> Red Norvell, who is attracted to Sif, kidnaps her when he gains Thor's power (thanks to Loki). She convinces him to return and save Asgard from [[Ragnarök]].<ref name="thor274276">''Thor'' #274–276 (Aug. – Oct. 1978)</ref> Later, she breaks a deadlock of votes, allowing Thor to return to Earth.<ref name="thor313">''Thor'' #313 (Nov. 1981)</ref>

Later the alien warrior [[Beta Ray Bill]] comes to the defense of Earth during a war with Surtur and his demon army. In the midst of battle Sif and Bill find themselves attracted to each other. Meanwhile, [[Lorelei (Asgardian)|Lorelei]] has given Thor an elixir that causes him to fall in love with her, and he is so blinded by the spell that he strikes Sif in anger. When the war is over, Sif and Bill spend some time on Earth exploring their mutual attraction before returning to Asgard. Sif eventually returns and finally comes to forgive Thor, after she realizes that Lorelei was to blame for his brutality.<ref name="thor349359">''Thor'' #349–359 (Nov. 1984 – Sept. 1985)</ref> However, she clarifies to Balder that her love for Bill is purely platonic.<ref name="thor442">"Thor" #442 (Jan. 1992)</ref>

She also develops a romantic relationship with another mortal to wield Thor's power, [[Thunderstrike (Eric Masterson)|Eric Masterson]]. Despite this, Sif risks her life to travel to the realm of [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] to free what seems to be the soul of Thor from a mystical bag, pledging her loyalty to the demonic entity. She is manipulated into a new costume change and is sent to face down Eric and Balder in battle, who had willingly followed her, worried for the success of her mission. Eric and Sif eventually part realms as friends, but he leaves her with a favored leather jacket.<ref name="thor450455">''Thor'' #450–455 (Aug. – Dec. 1992)</ref>

===Thor's reign===
When Thor assumes the throne of Asgard following Odin's death, he becomes torn between his duties as king and his desire to keep mortals from harm. Thor resolves this by bringing Asgard to Earth and reshaping the world in his image. Though his intentions are noble, a nightmarish future follows as Thor's reign on Earth becomes tyrannical.<ref name="thorv24174">''Thor'' vol. 2, #41–74 (Nov. 2001 – Apr. 2004)</ref> Sif, unwilling to go along with this new vision, is exiled from Asgard. Thor eventually marries the Enchantress and has a son, [[Magni (Marvel Comics)|Magni]]. As an adult seeking understanding of these events, Magni finds Sif, who influences him to rise up against his father even though she still loves him.<ref name="thorv275">''Thor'' vol. 2, #75 (May 2004)</ref> Following Magni's death in a battle involving Thor, [[Thor Girl]] and [[Desak]], Thor sees the error of his ways and travels back in time to undo what he has done.<ref name="thorv279">''Thor'' vol. 2, #79 (July 2004)</ref>

After the timeline is reset, Loki brings about [[Ragnarök]] in Asgard, during which the godly forces swiftly lose ground. Sif survives the first wave of losses but loses an arm.<ref name="thorv280">''Thor'' vol. 2, #80 (Aug. 2004)</ref> She is rescued by Brunnhilde, who is later killed by [[List of Thor enemies#D|Durok the Demolisher]].<ref name="thorv282">''Thor'' vol. 2, #82 (Sept. 2004)</ref> Sif honors Brunnhilde's death by taking her sword and leading the [[Valkyrior (Marvel Comics)|Valkyrior]] in the final battle.<ref name="thorv283">''Thor'' vol. 2, #83 (Oct. 2004)</ref> Sif falls in battle against Surtur's forces, dying side by side with [[Volstagg]]. All of Asgard falls soon after.<ref name="thorv285">''Thor'' vol. 2, #85 (Dec. 2004)</ref>

===Reborn===
Thor returns in time and restores the pantheon, beginning with Heimdall.<ref name="thorv315">''Thor'' vol. 3, #1–5 (Sept. 2007 – Jan. 2008)</ref> After resurrecting the other gods, Donald Blake goes to a hospital to try to find the reborn Sif. After wrongly thinking that she was reborn in Donald Blake's former love, [[Jane Foster (comics)|Jane Foster]], he leaves thinking that Sif won't come back. However, that scene reveals that Sif was reborn in an elderly woman in that hospital named Mrs. Chambers, who is suffering from what is thought to be terminal cancer. [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] has masked her from Thor's abilities, giving her a mirror that shows Sif her true form but prevents her from revealing her identity. Her host remains in the hospital, fighting for her life. Thor wondered what would happen to the spirit of an Asgardian if their host died.<ref name="thorv38">''Thor'' Vol. 3, #8 (June 2008)</ref>

Loki later reveals to Thor what happened to Sif and advises him to find her before Loki returns to his true form.<ref name="thor601">''Thor'' #601 (June 2009)</ref> Upon learning the truth from Mrs. Chambers, Jane Foster calls Donald Blake and informs him that she has found Sif, and Thor succeeds in restoring her. With Sif resurrected, Mrs. Chambers passes away.<ref name="thor602">''Thor'' #602(Aug. 2009)</ref> Sif then joins Thor in exile in [[Broxton, Oklahoma]] and checks into the same hotel as Donald Blake under the name Sylvan.<ref name="thor603">''Thor'' #603 (Nov. 2009)</ref> While in Broxton, Sif struggles with the fact that Loki possessed her body while she was trapped in Mrs. Chambers' body. She aids Beta Ray Bill, whose starship, Skuttlebutt, has been invaded by virus-infected aliens.<ref name="sifcomic">''Sif'' #1 (June 2010)</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Timothy |last=Callahan |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=user_review&id=2137 |title=Review: Sif #1 |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |date=April 21, 2010 |accessdate=September 29, 2010 }}</ref> Sif is later seen defending Asgard during the [[Siege (comics)|Siege of Asgard]] and the [[Fear Itself (comics)|Serpent's War]].<ref name="siege2">''Siege'' #2 (Apr. 2010)</ref><ref>''Fear Itself'' #1 (June 2011)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Sif shares [[Asgard (comics)#Racial attributes|powers common among all Asgardians]], with her dense physiology granting superhuman strength greater than the average Asgardian female and on par with the average Asgardian male, limited invulnerability, as well as advanced stamina, speed, agility, and reflexes. Sif is also extremely long lived and maintains her youth and vitality through the consumption of [[Golden apple#Norse mythology|golden apples]]. She is also highly skilled in [[hand to hand combat]] and proficient in the use of [[cold weapon]]s, favoring a sword and shield in battle. She is often said to be the best female fighter in Asgard, on par with Valkyrie.<ref>''[[Thor: Son of Asgard]]'' #8</ref>

In early appearances, Sif also possessed the innate ability to teleport herself and others from Earth to Asgard.<ref name="thor137140"/>  At some point, Sif began relying on her enchanted sword, which could "cleave" open gateways to other destinations besides Earth and Asgard through a complex array of swinging motions.<ref name="thor231"/><ref name="thor234">''Thor'' #234 (Apr. 1975)</ref> However, during ''The Reigning'', after Thor failed to truly resurrect a young girl, Sif was once again able to teleport herself and Thor away without the use of her sword.{{issue|date=November 2010}} Sif and Balder relied on the Norn Stones to teleport when they were looking for Thor.
