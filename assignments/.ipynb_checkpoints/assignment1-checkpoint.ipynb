In fact, it turns out that the *eigenvectors* of the covariance matrix are a set of mutually orthogonal vectors, that point in the directions of greatest variance in the data. The eigenvector with the greatest *eigenvalue* points along the direction of greatest variation, and so on. This is pretty neat, because if we know along which axes the data is most stretched, we can figure out how best to project it when visualizing it in 2D as a scatter plot! This whole procedure has a name: **Principal Component Analysis** (PCA) and it was invented by Karl Pearson in 1901. It belongs to a powerful class of linear algebra methods called **Matrix Factorization** methods. Ok, so rather than spending too much time on the math of PCA, let's just use the `sklearn` implementation and fit a PCA on `X`."

We can note that, by examining an estimate of how many characters have the shortest page lengths in each group, ambiguous characters seem the most popular, followed by heroes, and then villains. It seems in general, that there is more to discuss about ambiguous characters. This could be attributed to ambiguous character potentially causing more drama as they have dabbled in both sides of the MCU."
