    "A network is a way to represent a system of things that interact or are interrelated in some fashion. It could just be your facebook network, that's obvious, but a network can also represent the interaction patterns of proteins in the human body, who votes what on whose bill in the US Senate, the mutually attractive forces between galaxies in the universe or just about anything else that you can possibly imagine.
